network. If they are not listed, it means you will likely have to select a new doctor.

Understanding Important Rules
Effect on Current Coverage. If you are currently enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, your curr
Medicare Advantage healthcare coverage will end once your new Medicare Advantage coverage
starts. If you have Tricare, your coverage may be affected once your new Medicare Advantage
coverage starts. Please contact Tricare for more information. If you have a Medigap plan, once yo
Medicare Advantage coverage starts, you may want to drop your Medigap policy because you wil
paying for coverage you cannot use.
You must continue to pay your Medicare Part B premium. This premium is normally taken out of
Social Security check each month.
Benefits, premiums and/or copayments/co-insurance may change on January 1, 2025.
Our plan allows you to see providers outside of our network (non-contracted providers). Howeve
while we will pay for covered services provided by a non-contracted provider, the provider must
agree to treat you. Except in an emergency or urgent situation, non-contracted providers may de
care. In addition, you will pay a higher co-pay for services received by non-contracted providers.
