SECTION 4 During the Deductible Stage, you pay the full cost of
your drugs
The Deductible Stage is the first payment stage for your drug coverage. You will pay
a yearly deductible of $505 on drugs. You must pay the full cost of your drugs until
you reach the planâ€™s deductible amount. The "full cost" is usually lower than the
normal full price of the drug, since our plan has negotiated lower costs for most drugs
at network pharmacies.
Once you have paid $505 for your drugs, you leave the Deductible Stage and move
on to the Initial Coverage Stage.
