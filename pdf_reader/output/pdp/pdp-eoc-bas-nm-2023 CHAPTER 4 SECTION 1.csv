SECTION 1 Introduction

*Section 1.1 Use this chapter together with other materials that explain your
drug coverage
This chapter focuses on what you pay for Part D prescription drugs. To keep things
simple, we use “drug” in this chapter to mean a Part D prescription drug. As explained
in Chapter 3, not all drugs are Part D drugs – some drugs are covered under Medicare
Part A or Part B and other drugs are excluded from Medicare coverage by law.
To understand the payment information, you need to know what drugs are covered,
where to fill your prescriptions, and what rules to follow when you get your covered
drugs. Chapter 3, Sections 1 through 4 explain these rules.

*Section 1.2 Types of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for covered drugs
There are different types of out-of-pocket costs for Part D drugs. The amount that
you pay for a drug is called “cost sharing,” and there are three ways you may be asked
to pay.
The “deductible” is the amount you pay for drugs before our plan begins to
pay its share.
“Copayment” is a fixed amount each time you fill a prescription.
“Coinsurance” is a percentage of the total cost of the drug each time you fill
a prescription.

*Section 1.3 How Medicare calculates your out-of-pocket costs
Medicare has rules about what counts and what does not count toward your
out-of-pocket costs. Here are the rules we must follow to keep track of your
out-of-pocket costs.
These payments are included in your out-of-pocket costs
Your out-of-pocket costs include the payments listed below (as long as they are for
Part D covered drugs and you followed the rules for drug coverage that are explained
in Chapter 5):
The amount you pay for drugs when you are in any of the following drug
payment stages:
The Deductible Stage
The Initial Coverage Stage
Any payments you made during this calendar year as a member of a different
Medicare prescription drug plan before you joined our plan.
It matters who pays:
If you make these payments yourself, they are included in your out-of-pocket
costs.
These payments are also included if they are made on your behalf by certain
other individuals or organizations. This includes payments for your drugs
made by a friend or relative, by most charities, by AIDS drug assistance
programs, or by the Indian Health Service. Payments made by Medicare’s
“Extra Help” Program are also included.
Some payments made by the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program are
included. The amount the manufacturer pays for your brand name drugs is
included. But the amount the plan pays for your generic drugs is not included.
Moving on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage:
When you (or those paying on your behalf) have spent a total of $7,400 in
out-of-pocket costs within the calendar year, you will move from the Coverage Gap
Stage to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage.
These payments are not included in your out-of-pocket costs
Your out-of-pocket costs do not include any of these types of payments:
Your monthly premium.
Drugs you buy outside the United States and its territories.
Drugs that are not covered by our plan.
Drugs you get at an out-of-network pharmacy that do not meet the plan’s
requirements for out-of-network coverage.
Payments you make toward prescription drugs not normally covered in a
Medicare Prescription Drug Plan.
Payments made by the plan for your brand or generic drugs while in the
Coverage Gap.
Payments for your drugs that are made by group health plans including
employer health plans.
Payments for your drugs that are made by certain insurance plans and
government-funded health programs such as TRICARE and the Veterans
Affairs.
Payments for your drugs made by a third-party with a legal obligation to pay
for prescription costs (for example, Workers’ Compensation).
Reminder: If any other organization such as the ones listed above pays part or all of
your out-of-pocket costs for drugs, you are required to tell our plan by calling Customer
Service.
How can you keep track of your out-of-pocket total?
We will help you. The Part D EOB report you receive includes the current
amount of your out-of-pocket costs. When this amount reaches $7,400, this
report will tell you that you have left the Coverage Gap Stage and have moved
on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage.
Make sure we have the information we need. Section 3.2 tells what you can
do to help make sure that our records of what you have spent are complete
and up to date.
