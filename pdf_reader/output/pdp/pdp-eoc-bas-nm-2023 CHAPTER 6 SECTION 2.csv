SECTION 2 You have some responsibilities as a member of the plan
Things you need to do as a member of the plan are listed below. If you have any
questions, please call Customer Service.
Get familiar with your covered drugs and the rules you must follow to
get these covered drugs. Use this Evidence of Coverage to learn what is
covered for you and the rules you need to follow to get your covered drugs.
Chapters 3 and 4 give the details about your coverage for Part D
prescription drugs.
If you have any other prescription drug coverage in addition to our plan,
you are required to tell us. Chapter 1 tells you about coordinating these
benefits.
Tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are enrolled in our plan. Show
your plan membership card whenever you get your Part D prescription drugs.
Help your doctors and other providers help you by giving them
information, asking questions, and following through on your care.
To help get the best care, tell your doctors and other health providers
about your health problems. Follow the treatment plans and instructions
that you and your doctors agree upon.
Make sure your doctors know all of the drugs you are taking, including
over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements.
If you have any questions, be sure to ask and get an answer you can
understand.
Pay what you owe. As a plan member, you are responsible for these
payments:
You must pay your plan.
For most of your drugs covered by the plan, you must pay your share of
the cost when you get the drug.
If you are required to pay a late enrollment penalty, you must pay the
penalty to remain a member of the plan.
If you are required to pay the extra amount for Part D because of your
yearly income, you must continue to pay the extra amount directly to
the government to remain a member of the plan.
If you move within our service area, we need to know so we can keep
your membership record up to date and know how to contact you.
If you move outside of our plan service area, you cannot remain a member
of our plan.
If you move, it is also important to tell Social Security (or the Railroad
Retirement Board).
