SECTION 4 Quality Improvement Organization
There is a designated Quality Improvement Organization for serving Medicare
beneficiaries in each state. For New Mexico, the Quality Improvement Organization
is called KEPRO.
KEPRO has a group of doctors and other health care professionals who are paid by
Medicare to check on and help improve the quality of care for people with Medicare.
KEPRO is an independent organization. It is not connected with our plan.
You should contact KEPRO if you have a complaint about the quality of care you have
received. For example, you can contact KEPRO if you were given the wrong medication
or if you were given medications that interact in a negative way.
