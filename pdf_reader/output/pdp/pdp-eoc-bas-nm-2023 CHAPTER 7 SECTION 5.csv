SECTION 5 Your Part D prescription drugs: How to ask for a
coverage decision or make an appeal

*Section 5.1 This section tells you what to do if you have problems getting a
Part D drug or you want us to pay you back for a Part D drug
Your benefits include coverage for many prescription drugs. To be covered, the drug
must be used for a medically accepted indication. (See Chapter 5 for more information
about a medically accepted indication.) For details about Part D drugs, rules,
restrictions, and costs please see Chapters 5 and 6.
This section is about your Part D drugs only. To keep things simple, we
generally say “drug” in the rest of this section, instead of repeating “covered
outpatient prescription drug” or “Part D drug” every time. We also use the
term “drug list” instead of “List of Covered Drugs” or “Formulary.”
If you do not know if a drug is covered or if you meet the rules, you can ask
us. Some drugs require that you get approval from us before we will cover
it.
If your pharmacy tells you that your prescription cannot be filled as written,
the pharmacy will give you a written notice explaining how to contact us to
ask for a coverage decision.
Part D coverage decisions and appeals
Legal Terms
An initial coverage decision about your Part D drugs is called a “coverage
determination.”
A coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about
the amount we will pay for your drugs. This section tells what you can do if you are
in any of the following situations:
Asking to cover a Part D drug that is not on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs.
Ask for an exception. Section 5.2
Asking to waive a restriction on the plan’s coverage for a drug (such as limits
on the amount of the drug you can get) Ask for an exception. Section 5.2
Asking to pay a lower cost-sharing amount for a covered drug on a higher
cost-sharing tier Ask for an exception. Section 5.2
Asking to get pre-approval for a drug. Ask for a coverage decision. Section
5.4
Pay for a prescription drug you already bought. Ask us to pay you back.

*Section 5.4
If you disagree with a coverage decision we have made, you can appeal our decision.
This section tells you both how to ask for coverage decisions and how to request an
appeal.

*Section 5.2 What is an exception?
Legal Terms
Asking for coverage of a drug that is not on the Drug List is sometimes called asking
for a “formulary exception.”
Asking for removal of a restriction on coverage for a drug is sometimes called asking
for a “formulary exception.”
Asking to pay a lower price for a covered non-preferred drug is sometimes called
asking for a “tiering exception.”
If a drug is not covered in the way you would like it to be covered, you can ask us to
make an “exception.” An exception is a type of coverage decision.
For us to consider your exception request, your doctor or other prescriber will need
to explain the medical reasons why you need the exception approved. Here are three
examples of exceptions that you or your doctor or other prescriber can ask us to
make:
1. Covering a Part D drug for you that is not on our Drug List. If we agree to
cover a drug not on the Drug List, you will need to pay the cost-sharing amount
that applies to drugs in Tier 4. You cannot ask for an exception to the copayment
or coinsurance amount we require you to pay for the drug.
2. Removing a restriction for a covered drug. Chapter 3 describes the extra rules
or restrictions that apply to certain drugs on our Drug List. If we agree to make
an exception and waive a restriction for you, you can ask for an exception to the
copayment or coinsurance amount we require you to pay for the drug.
3. Changing coverage of a drug to a lower cost-sharing tier. Every drug on our
Drug List is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the lower the cost-sharing
tier number, the less you will pay as your share of the cost of the drug.
If our drug list contains alternative drug(s) for treating your medical condition
that are in a lower cost-sharing tier than your drug, you can ask us to cover
your drug at the cost-sharing amount that applies to the alternative drug(s).
If the drug you’re taking is a biological product you can ask us to cover your
drug at a lower cost-sharing. This would be the lowest tier cost that contains
biological product alternatives for treating your condition.
If the drug you’re taking is a brand name drug you can ask us to cover your
drug at the cost-sharing amount that applies to the lowest tier that contains
brand name alternatives for treating your condition.
If the drug you’re taking is a generic drug you can ask us to cover your drug
at the cost-sharing amount that applies to the lowest tier that contains either
brand or generic alternatives for treating your condition.
You cannot ask us to change the cost-sharing tier for any drug in Tier 5
(Specialty).
If we approve your tiering exception request and there is more than one
lower cost-sharing tier with alternative drugs you can’t take, you will usually
pay the lowest amount.

*Section 5.3 Important things to know about asking for exceptions
Your doctor must tell us the medical reasons
Your doctor or other prescriber must give us a statement that explains the medical
reasons for requesting an exception. For a faster decision, include this medical
information from your doctor or other prescriber when you ask for the exception.
Typically, our Drug List includes more than one drug for treating a particular condition.
These different possibilities are called “alternative” drugs. If an alternative drug would
be just as effective as the drug you are requesting and would not cause more side
effects or other health problems, we will generally not approve your request for an
exception. If you ask us for a tiering exception, we will generally not approve your
request for an exception unless all the alternative drugs in the lower cost-sharing
tier(s) won’t work as well for you or are likely to cause an adverse reaction or other
harm.
We can say yes or no to your request
If we approve your request for an exception, our approval usually is valid
until the end of the plan year. This is true as long as your doctor continues
to prescribe the drug for you and that drug continues to be safe and effective
for treating your condition.
If we say no to your request, you can ask for another review by making an
appeal.

*Section 5.4 Step-by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision, including an
exception
Legal Terms
A “fast coverage decision” is called an “expedited coverage determination.”
Step 1: Decide if you need a “standard coverage decision” or a “fast coverage
decision.”
“Standard coverage decisions” are made within 72 hours after we receive your
doctor’s statement. “Fast coverage decisions” are made within 24 hours after we
receive your doctor’s statement.
If your health requires it, ask us to give you a “fast coverage decision.”To get a fast
coverage decision, you must meet two requirements:
You must be asking for a drug you have not yet received. (You cannot ask for
fast coverage decision to be paid back for a drug you have already bought.)
Using the standard deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt
your ability to function.
If your doctor or other prescriber tells us that your health requires a
“fast coverage decision,” we will automatically give you a fast coverage
decision.
If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor
or prescriber’s support, we will decide whether your health requires
that we give you a fast coverage decision. If we do not approve a fast
coverage decision, we will send you a letter that:
Explains that we will use the standard deadlines.
Explains if your doctor or other prescriber asks for the fast coverage
decision, we will automatically give you a fast coverage decision.
Tells you how you can file a “fast complaint” about our decision to give
you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision
you requested. We will answer your complaint within 24 hours of receipt.
Step 2: Request a “standard coverage decision” or a “fast coverage decision.”
Start by calling, writing, or faxing our plan to make your request for us to authorize
or provide coverage for the medical care you want. You can also access the coverage
decision process through our website. We must accept any written request, including
a request submitted on the CMS Model Coverage Determination Request Form, which
is available on our website. Chapter 2 has contact information. To assist us in
processing your request, please be sure to include your name, contact information,
and information identifying which denied claim is being appealed.
You, your doctor, (or other prescriber) or your representative can do this. You can
also have a lawyer act on your behalf. Section 4 of this chapter tells how you can give
written permission to someone else to act as your representative.
If you are requesting an exception, provide the “supporting statement,”
Which is the medical reasons for the exception. Your doctor or other
prescriber can fax or mail the statement to us. Or your doctor or other
prescriber can tell us on the phone and follow up by faxing or mailing a written
statement if necessary.
Step 3: We consider your request and give you our answer.
Deadlines for a “fast coverage decision”
We must generally give you our answer within 24 hours after we receive your
request.
For exceptions, we will give you our answer within 24 hours after we
receive your doctor’s supporting statement. We will give you our answer
sooner if your health requires us to.
If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request
on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an
independent review organization.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must provide
the coverage we have agreed to provide within 24 hours after we receive
your request or doctor’s statement supporting your request.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no. We will also tell you how
you can appeal.
Deadlines for a “standard” coverage decision about a drug you have not yet received
We must generally give you our answer within72 hours after we receive your
request.
For exceptions, we will give you our answer within 72 hours after we
receive your doctor’s supporting statement. We will give you our answer
sooner if your health requires us to.
If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request
on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an
independent review organization.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must provide
the coverage we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we receive
your request or doctor’s statement supporting your request.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no. We will also tell you how
you can appeal.
Deadlines for a “standard” coverage decision about payment for a drug you have
already bought
We must give you our answer within 14 calendar days after we receive your
request.
If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request
on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an
independent review organization.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we are also
required to make payment to you within 14 calendar days after we receive
your request.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no. We will also tell you how
you can appeal.
Step 4: If we say no to your coverage request, you can make an appeal.
If we say no, you have the right to ask us to reconsider this decision by making
an appeal. This means asking again to get the drug coverage you want. If you
make an appeal, it means you are going on to Level 1 of the appeals process.

*Section 5.5 Step-by-step: How to make a Level 1 appeal
Legal Terms
An appeal to the plan about a Part D drug coverage decision is called a plan
“redetermination.”
A “fast appeal” is also called an “expedited redetermination.”
Step 1: Decide if you need a “standard appeal” or a “fast appeal.”
A “standard appeal” is usually made within 7 days. A “fast appeal” is generally
made within 72 hours. If your health requires it, ask for a “fast appeal”
If you are appealing a decision we made about a drug you have not yet
received, you and your doctor or other prescriber will need to decide if you
need a “fast appeal.”
The requirements for getting a “fast appeal” are the same as those for getting
a “fast coverage decision” in Section 6.4 of this chapter.
Step 2: You, your representative, doctor, or other prescriber must contact us
and make your Level 1 appeal. If your health requires a quick response, you must
ask for a“fast appeal.”
For standard appeals, submit a written request. Chapter 2 has contact
information.
For fast appeals either submit your appeal in writing or call us at
(1-888-285-2249). Chapter 2 has contact information.
We must accept any written request, including a request submitted on
the CMS Model Coverage Determination Request Form, which is available on
our website. Please be sure to include your name, contact information, and
information regarding your claim to assist us in processing your request.
You must make your appeal request within 60 calendar days from the
date on the written notice we sent to tell you our answer on the coverage
decision. If you miss this deadline and have a good reason for missing it,
explain the reason your appeal is late when you make your appeal. We may
give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of good cause may include
a serious illness that prevented you from contacting us or if we provided you
with incorrect or incomplete information about the deadline for requesting
an appeal.
You can ask for a copy of the information in your appeal and add more
information. You and your doctor may add more information to support
your appeal. We are allowed to charge a fee for copying and sending this
information to you.
Step 3: We consider your appeal and we give you our answer.
When we are reviewing your appeal, we take another careful look at all of
the information about your coverage request. We check to see if we were
following all the rules when we said no to your request.
We may contact you or your doctor or other prescriber to get more
information.
Deadlines for a “fast appeal”
For fast appeals, we must give you our answer within 72 hours after we
receive your appeal. We will give you our answer sooner if your health
requires it.
If we do not give you an answer within 72 hours, we are required to send
your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be
reviewed by an independent review organization. Section 6.6 explains
the Level 2 appeal process.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must provide
the coverage we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we receive
your appeal.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no and how you can appeal
our decision.
Deadlines for a “standard” appeal for a drug you have not yet received
For standard appeals, we must give you our answer within 7 calendar days
after we receive your appeal. We will give you our decision sooner if you have
not received the drug yet and your health condition requires us to do so.
If we do not give you a decision within 7 calendar days, we are required
to send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will
be reviewed by an independent review organization. Section 6.6 explains
the Level 2 appeal process.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must provide
the coverage as quickly as your health requires, but no later than 7 calendar
days after we receive your appeal.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no and how you can appeal
our decision.
Deadlines for a “standard appeal” about payment for a drug you have already
bought
We must give you our answer within 14 calendar days after we receive your
request.
If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request
on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an
independent review organization.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we are also
required to make payment to you within 30 calendar days after we receive
your request.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no. We will also tell you how
you can appeal.
Step 4: If we say no to your appeal, you decide if you want to continue with the
appeals process and make another appeal.
If you decide to make another appeal, it means your appeal is going on to
Level 2 of the appeals process.

*Section 5.6 Step-by-step: How to make a Level 2 appeal
Legal Terms
The formal name for the “independent review organization” is the “Independent
Review Entity.” It is sometimes called the “IRE.”
The independent review organization is an independent organization hired by
Medicare. It is not connected with us and is not a government agency. This
organization decides whether the decision we made is correct or if it should be
changed. Medicare oversees its work.
Step 1: You (or your representative or your doctor or other prescriber) must
contact the independent review organization and ask for a review of your case.
If we say no to your Level 1 appeal, the written notice we send you will include
instructions on how to make a Level 2 appeal with the independent review
organization. These instructions will tell who can make this Level 2 appeal,
what deadlines you must follow, and how to reach the review organization.
If, however, we did not complete our review within the applicable timeframe,
or make an unfavorable decision regarding “at-risk” determination under our
drug management program, we will automatically forward your claim to the
IRE.
We will send the information we have about your appeal to this organization.
This information is called your “case file.” You have the right to ask us for
a copy of your case file. We are allowed to charge you a fee for copying and
sending this information to you.
You have a right to give the independent review organization additional
information to support your appeal.
Step 2: The independent review organization reviews your appeal.
Reviewers at the independent review organization will take a careful look at
all of the information related to your appeal.
Deadlines for “fast appeal”
If your health requires it, ask the independent review organization for a “fast
appeal.”
If the organization agrees to give you a “fast appeal,” the organization must
give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal within 72 hours after it receives
your appeal request.
Deadlines for “standard appeal”
For standard appeals, the review organization must give you an answer to
your Level 2 appeal within 7 calendar days after it receives your appeal if
it is for a drug you have not yet received. If you are requesting that we pay
you back for a drug you have already bought, the review organization must
give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal within 14 calendar days after it
receives your request
Step 3: The independent review organization gives you their answer.
For “fast appeals”:
If the independent review organization says yes to part or all of what
you requested, we must provide the drug coverage that was approved by
the review organization within 24 hours after we receive the decision from
the review organization.
For “standard appeals”:
If the independent review organization says yes to part or all of your
request for coverage, we must provide the drug coverage that was
approved by the review organization within 72 hours after we receive the
decision from the review organization.
If the independent review organization says yes to part or all of your request
to pay you back for a drug you already bought, we are required to send
payment to you within 30 calendar days after we receive the decision from
the review organization.
What if the review organization says no to your appeal?
If this organization says no to part or all of your appeal, it means they agree with
our decision not to approve your request (or part of your request). (This is called
“upholding the decision.” It is also called “turning down your appeal.”) In this case, the
independent review organization will send you a letter:
Explaining its decision.
Notifying you of the right to a Level 3 appeal if the dollar value of the drug
coverage you are requesting meets a certain minimum. If the dollar value of
the drug coverage you are requesting is too low, you cannot make another
appeal and the decision at Level 2 is final.
Telling you the dollar value that must be in dispute to continue with the
appeals process.
Step 4: If your case meets the requirements, you choose whether you want to
take your appeal further.
There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a
total of five levels of appeal).
If you want to go on to a Level 3 appeal, the details on how to do this are in
the written notice you get after your Level 2 appeal decision.
The Level 3 appeal is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney
adjudicator. Section 6 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of
the appeals process.
