SECTION 6 Medicaid
Medicaid is a joint Federal and state government program that helps with medical
costs for certain people with limited incomes and resources. Some people with
Medicare are also eligible for Medicaid. The programs offered through Medicaid help
people with Medicare pay their Medicare costs, such as their Medicare premiums.
These “Medicare Savings Programs”:
Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB): Helps pay Medicare Part A and
Part B premiums, and other cost sharing (like deductibles, coinsurance, and
copayments). (Some people with QMB are also eligible for full Medicaid
benefits (QMB+).)
Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB): Helps pay Part B
premiums. (Some people with SLMB are also eligible for full Medicaid benefits
(SLMB+).)
Qualifying Individual (QI): Helps pay Part B premiums.
Qualified Disabled & Working Individuals (QDWI): Helps pay Part A
premiums.
