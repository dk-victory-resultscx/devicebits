SECTION 6 Keeping your plan membership record up to date
Your membership record has information from your enrollment form, including your
address and telephone number. It shows your specific plan coverage.
The pharmacists in the plan’s network need to have correct information about
you. These network providers use your membership record to know what drugs
are covered and the cost-sharing amounts for you. Because of this, it is very
important that you help us keep your information up to date.
Let us know about these changes:
Changes to your name, your address, or your phone number
Changes in any other medical or drug insurance coverage you have (such as
from your employer, your spouse’s employer, workers’ compensation, or
Medicaid)
If you have any liability claims, such as claims from an automobile accident
If you have been admitted to a nursing home
If your designated responsible party (such as a caregiver) changes
If any of this information changes, please let us know by calling Customer Service.
It is also important to contact Social Security if you move or change your mailing
address. You can find phone numbers and contact information for Social Security in
Chapter 2, Section 5.
