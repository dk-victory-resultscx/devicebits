SECTION 6 Costs in the Coverage Gap Stage
When you are in the Coverage Gap Stage, the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount
Program provides manufacturer discounts on brand name drugs. You pay 25% of the
negotiated price and a portion of the dispensing fee for brand name drugs. Both the
amount you pay and the amount discounted by the manufacturer count toward your
out-of-pocket costs as if you had paid them and move you through the coverage gap.
You also receive some coverage for generic drugs. You pay no more than 25% of the
cost for generic drugs and the plan pays the rest. Only the amount you pay counts
and moves you through the coverage gap.
You continue paying these costs until your yearly out-of-pocket payments reach a
maximum amount that Medicare has set. Once you reach this amount $7,400, you
leave the Coverage Gap Stage and move to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage.
Medicare has rules about what counts and what does not count as your out-of-pocket
costs (Section 1.3).
