CHAPTER 5:
Asking us to pay our share of the
costs for covered drugs

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 Situations in which you should ask us to pay our share
of the cost of your covered drugs
Sometimes when you get a prescription drug, you may need to pay the full cost. Other
times, you may find that you have paid more than you expected under the coverage
rules of the plan or you may receive a bill from a provider. In these cases, you can ask
our plan to pay you back (paying you back is often called “reimbursing” you). There
may be deadlines that you must meet to get paid back. Please see Section 2 of this
chapter.
Here are examples of situations in which you may need to ask our plan to pay you
back. All of these examples are types of coverage decisions (for more information
about coverage decisions, go to Chapter 7).
1. When you use an out-of-network pharmacy to get a prescription filled
If you go to an out-of-network pharmacy, the pharmacy may not be able to submit
the claim directly to us. When that happens, you will have to pay the full cost of
your prescription.
Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our
share of the cost. Remember that we only cover out of network pharmacies in
limited circumstances. See Chapter 3, Section 2.5 for a discussion of these
circumstances.
2. When you pay the full cost for a prescription because you don’t have your
plan membership card with you
If you do not have your plan membership card with you, you can ask the pharmacy
to call the plan or look up your enrollment information. However, if the pharmacy
cannot get the enrollment information they need right away, you may need to pay
the full cost of the prescription yourself.
Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our
share of the cost.
3. When you pay the full cost for a prescription in other situations
You may pay the full cost of the prescription because you find that the drug is not
covered for some reason.
For example, the drug may not be on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs
(Formulary); or it could have a requirement or restriction that you didn’t know
about or don’t think should apply to you. If you decide to get the drug
immediately, you may need to pay the full cost for it.
Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back. In
some situations, we may need to get more information from your doctor in
order to pay you back for our share of the cost.
4. If you are retroactively enrolled in our plan
Sometimes a person’s enrollment in the plan is retroactive. (This means that the
first day of their enrollment has already passed. The enrollment date may even
have occurred last year.)
If you were retroactively enrolled in our plan and you paid out-of-pocket for any
of your drugs after your enrollment date, you can ask us to pay you back for our
share of the costs. You will need to submit paperwork for us to handle the
reimbursement.
All of the examples above are types of coverage decisions. This means that if we deny
your request for payment, you can appeal our decision. Chapter 7 of this document
has information about how to make an appeal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 How to ask us to pay you back
You may request us to pay you back by sending us a request in writing. If you send
request in writing, send your receipt documenting the payment you have made. It’s
a good idea to make a copy of your receipts for your records. You must submit your
claim to us within 36 months of the date you received the service, item, or drug.
To make sure you are giving us all the information we need to make a decision, you
can fill out our claim form to make your request for payment.
You don’t have to use the form, but it will help us process the information
faster.
Either download a copy of the form from our website (getbluenm.com/pdp)
or call Customer Service and ask for the form.
Mail your request for payment together with any bills or paid receipts to us at this
address:
Prescription Drug Claims Payment Request
PO Box 20970
Lehigh Valley, PA 18002-0970

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 We will consider your request for payment and say yes
or no

*Section 3.1 We check to see whether we should cover the drug and how
much we owe
When we receive your request for payment, we will let you know if we need any
additional information from you. Otherwise, we will consider your request and make
a coverage decision.
If we decide that the drug is covered and you followed all the rules, we will
pay for our share of the cost. We will mail your reimbursement of our share
of the cost to you. We will send payment within 30 days after your request
was received.
If we decide that the drug is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules,
we will not pay for our share of the cost. We will send you a letter explaining
the reasons why we are not sending the payment and your rights to appeal
that decision.

*Section 3.2 If we tell you that we will not pay for all or part of the drug, you
can make an appeal
If you think we have made a mistake in turning down your request for payment or
the amount we are paying, you can make an appeal. If you make an appeal, it means
you are asking us to change the decision we made when we turned down your request
for payment.
The appeals process is a formal process with detailed procedures and important
deadlines. For the details on how to make this appeal, go to Chapter 7 of this document.
