CHAPTER 4:
What you pay for your Part D
prescription drugs
Are you currently getting help to pay for your drugs?
If you are in a program that helps pay for your drugs, some information in this
Evidence of Coverage about the costs for Part D prescription drugs may not apply
to you. We have included a separate insert, called the “Evidence of Coverage Rider
for People Who Get Extra Help Paying for Prescription Drugs” (also known as the “Low
Income Subsidy Rider” or the “LIS Rider”), which tells you about your drug coverage.
If you don’t have this insert, please call Customer Service and ask for the “LIS Rider.”
