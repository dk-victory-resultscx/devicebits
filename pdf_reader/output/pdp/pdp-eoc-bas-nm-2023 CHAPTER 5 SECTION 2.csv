SECTION 2 How to ask us to pay you back
You may request us to pay you back by sending us a request in writing. If you send
request in writing, send your receipt documenting the payment you have made. It’s
a good idea to make a copy of your receipts for your records. You must submit your
claim to us within 36 months of the date you received the service, item, or drug.
To make sure you are giving us all the information we need to make a decision, you
can fill out our claim form to make your request for payment.
You don’t have to use the form, but it will help us process the information
faster.
Either download a copy of the form from our website (getbluenm.com/pdp)
or call Customer Service and ask for the form.
Mail your request for payment together with any bills or paid receipts to us at this
address:
