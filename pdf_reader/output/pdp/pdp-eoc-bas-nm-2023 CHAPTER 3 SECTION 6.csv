SECTION 6 What if your coverage changes for one of your drugs?

*Section 6.1 The Drug List can change during the year
Most of the changes in drug coverage happen at the beginning of each year ( January
1). However, during the year, the plan can make some changes to the Drug List. For
example, the plan might:
Add or remove drugs from the Drug List.
Move a drug to a higher or lower cost-sharing tier.
Add or remove a restriction on coverage for a drug.
Replace a brand name drug with a generic drug.
We must follow Medicare requirements before we change the plan’s Drug List.

*Section 6.2 What happens if coverage changes for a drug you are taking?
Information on changes to drug coverage
When changes to the Drug List occur, we post information on our website about those
changes. We also update our online Drug List on a regularly scheduled basis. Below
we point out the times that you would get direct notice if changes are made to a drug
that you are taking.
Changes to your drug coverage that affect you during the current plan year
A new generic drug replaces a brand name drug on the Drug List (or we
change the cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions to the brand name
drug or both)
We may immediately remove a brand name drug on our Drug List if we
are replacing it with a newly approved generic version of the same drug.
The generic drug will appear on the same or lower cost-sharing tier and
with the same or fewer restrictions. We may decide to keep the brand
name drug on our Drug List, but immediately move it to a higher
cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions or both when the new generic
is added.
We may not tell you in advance before we make that change—even if
you are currently taking the brand name drug. If you are taking the brand
name drug at the time we make the change, we will provide you with
information about the specific change(s). This will also include information
on the steps you may take to request an exception to cover the brand
name drug. You may not get this notice before we make the change.
You or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to
cover the brand name drug for you. For information on how to ask for
an exception, see Chapter 7.
Unsafe drugs and other drugs on the Drug List that are withdrawn from
the market
Once in a while, a drug may be suddenly withdrawn because it has been
found to be unsafe or removed from the market for another reason. If
this happens, we will immediately remove the drug from the Drug List.
If you are taking that drug, we will let you know of this change right away.
Your prescriber will also know about this change, and can work with you
to find another drug for your condition.
Other changes to drugs on the Drug List
We may make other changes once the year has started that affect drugs
you are taking. For example, we might add a generic drug that is not new
to the market to replace a brand name drug on the Drug List or change
the cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions to the brand name drug or
both. We also might make changes based on FDA boxed warnings or
new clinical guidelines recognized by Medicare.
For these changes, we must give you at least 30 days’ advance notice of
the change or give you notice of the change and a 30-day refill of the
drug you are taking at a network pharmacy.
After you receive notice of the change, you should work with your
provider to switch to a different drug that we cover or to satisfy any new
restrictions on the drug you are taking.
You or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to
cover the drug for you. For information on how to ask for an exception,
see Chapter 7.
Changes to the Drug List that do not affect you during the plan year
We may make certain changes to the Drug List that are not described above. In these
cases, the change will not apply to you if you are taking the drug when the change is
made; however, these changes will likely affect you starting January 1 of the next plan
year if you stay in the same plan.
In general, changes that will not affect you during the current plan year are:
We move your drug into a higher cost-sharing tier.
We put a new restriction on the use of your drug.
We remove your drug from the Drug List.
If any of these changes happen for a drug you are taking (except for market withdrawal,
a generic drug replacing a brand name drug, or other change noted in the sections
above), then the change won’t affect your use or what you pay as your share of the
cost until January 1 of the next year. Until that date, you probably won’t see any
increase in your payments or any added restrictions to your use of the drug.
We will not tell you about these types of changes directly during the current plan year.
You will need to check the Drug List for the next plan year (when the list is available
during the open enrollment period) to see if there are any changes to the drugs you
are taking that will impact you during the next plan year.
