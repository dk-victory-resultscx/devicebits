SECTION 3 Important membership materials you will receive

*Section 3.1 Your plan membership card
While you are a member of our plan, you must use your membership card for
prescription drugs you get at network pharmacies. You should also show the provider
your Medicaid card, if applicable. Here’s a sample membership card to show you what
yours will look like:
Please carry your card with you at all times and remember to show your card when
you get covered drugs. If your plan membership card is damaged, lost, or stolen, call
Customer Service right away and we will send you a new card.
You may need to use your red, white, and blue Medicare card to get covered medical
care and services under Original Medicare.

*Section 3.2 Pharmacy Directory
The pharmacy directory lists our network pharmacies. Network pharmacies are all
of the pharmacies that have agreed to fill covered prescriptions for our plan members.
You can use the Pharmacy Directory to find the network pharmacy you want to use.
See Chapter 3, Section 2.5 for information on when you can use pharmacies that are
not in the plan’s network.
The Pharmacy Directory will also tell you which of the pharmacies in our network have
preferred cost sharing, which may be lower than the standard cost sharing offered
by other network pharmacies for some drugs.
If you don’t have the Pharmacy Directory, you can get a copy from Customer Service.
You can also find this information on our website at getbluenm.com/pdp.

*Section 3.3 The plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary)
The plan has a List of Covered Drugs (Formulary). We call it the “Drug List” for short. It
tells which Part D prescription drugs are covered under the Part D benefit included
in Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP). The drugs on this list are selected by the plan
with the help of a team of doctors and pharmacists. The list must meet requirements
set by Medicare. Medicare has approved the Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) Drug
List.
The Drug List also tells you if there are any rules that restrict coverage for your drugs.
We will provide you a copy of the Drug List. To get the most complete and current
information about which drugs are covered, you can visit the plan’s website (getbluenm.
com/pdp) or call Customer Service.
