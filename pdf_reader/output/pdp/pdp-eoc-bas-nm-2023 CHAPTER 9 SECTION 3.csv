SECTION 3 Notice about Medicare Secondary Payer subrogation
rights
We have the right and responsibility to collect for covered Medicare prescription drugs
for which Medicare is not the primary payer. According to CMS regulations at 42 CFR
sections 422.108 and 423.462, Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP), as a Medicare
prescription drug plan sponsor, will exercise the same rights of recovery that the
Secretary exercises under CMS regulations in subparts B through D of part 411 of 42
CFR and the rules established in this section supersede any State laws.
