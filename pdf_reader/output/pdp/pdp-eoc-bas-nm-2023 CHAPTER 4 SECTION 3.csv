SECTION 3 We send you reports that explain payments for your
drugs and which payment stage you are in

*Section 3.1 We send you a monthly summary called the “Part D Explanation
of Benefits” (the “Part D EOB”)
Our plan keeps track of the costs of your prescription drugs and the payments you
have made when you get your prescriptions filled or refilled at the pharmacy. This
way, we can tell you when you have moved from one drug payment stage to the next.
In particular, there are two types of costs we keep track of:
We keep track of how much you have paid. This is called your "out-of-pocket"
cost.
We keep track of your "total drug costs." This is the amount you pay
out-of-pocket or others pay on your behalf plus the amount paid by the plan.
If you have had one or more prescriptions filled through the plan during the previous
month we will send you a Part D Explanation of Benefits (“Part D EOB”). The Part D EOB
includes:
Information for that month. This report gives the payment details about
the prescriptions you have filled during the previous month. It shows the
total drugs costs, what the plan paid, and what you and others on your behalf
paid.
Totals for the year since January 1. This is called "year-to-date" information.
It shows the total drug costs and total payments for your drugs since the year
began.
Drug price information. This information will display the total drug price,
and information about increases in price from first fill for each prescription
claim of the same quantity.
Available lower cost alternative prescriptions. This will include information
about available drugs with lower cost sharing for each prescription claim.

*Section 3.2 Help us keep our information about your drug payments up to
date
To keep track of your drug costs and the payments you make for drugs, we use records
we get from pharmacies. Here is how you can help us keep your information correct
and up to date:
Show your membership card every time you get a prescription filled.
This helps us make sure we know about the prescriptions you are filling and
what you are paying.
Make sure we have the information we need. There are times you may
pay for the entire cost of a prescription drug. In these cases we will not
automatically get the information we need to keep track of your out-of-pocket
costs. To help us keep track of your out-of-pocket costs, give us copies of
these receipts. Here are examples of when you should give us copies of your
drug receipts:
When you purchase a covered drug at a network pharmacy at a special
price or using a discount card that is not part of our plan’s benefit.
When you made a copayment for drugs that are provided under a drug
manufacturer patient assistance program.
Any time you have purchased covered drugs at out-of-network
pharmacies or other times you have paid the full price for a covered drug
under special circumstances.
If you are billed for a covered drug, you can ask our plan to pay our share
of the cost. For instructions on how to do this, go to Chapter 7, Section
2.
Send us information about the payments others have made for you.
Payments made by certain other individuals and organizations also count
toward your out-of-pocket costs. For example, payments made by an AIDS
drug assistance program (ADAP), the Indian Health Service, and most charities
count toward your out-of-pocket costs. Keep a record of these payments and
send them to us so we can track your costs.
Check the written report we send you. When you receive a "Part D EOB,"
look it over to be sure the information is complete and correct. If you think
something is missing or you have any questions, please call us at Customer
Service. Be sure to keep these reports.
