CHAPTER 4:
What you pay for your Part D
prescription drugs
Are you currently getting help to pay for your drugs?
If you are in a program that helps pay for your drugs, some information in this
Evidence of Coverage about the costs for Part D prescription drugs may not apply
to you. We have included a separate insert, called the “Evidence of Coverage Rider
for People Who Get Extra Help Paying for Prescription Drugs” (also known as the “Low
Income Subsidy Rider” or the “LIS Rider”), which tells you about your drug coverage.
If you don’t have this insert, please call Customer Service and ask for the “LIS Rider.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 Introduction

*Section 1.1 Use this chapter together with other materials that explain your
drug coverage
This chapter focuses on what you pay for Part D prescription drugs. To keep things
simple, we use “drug” in this chapter to mean a Part D prescription drug. As explained
in Chapter 3, not all drugs are Part D drugs – some drugs are covered under Medicare
Part A or Part B and other drugs are excluded from Medicare coverage by law.
To understand the payment information, you need to know what drugs are covered,
where to fill your prescriptions, and what rules to follow when you get your covered
drugs. Chapter 3, Sections 1 through 4 explain these rules.

*Section 1.2 Types of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for covered drugs
There are different types of out-of-pocket costs for Part D drugs. The amount that
you pay for a drug is called “cost sharing,” and there are three ways you may be asked
to pay.
The “deductible” is the amount you pay for drugs before our plan begins to
pay its share.
“Copayment” is a fixed amount each time you fill a prescription.
“Coinsurance” is a percentage of the total cost of the drug each time you fill
a prescription.

*Section 1.3 How Medicare calculates your out-of-pocket costs
Medicare has rules about what counts and what does not count toward your
out-of-pocket costs. Here are the rules we must follow to keep track of your
out-of-pocket costs.
These payments are included in your out-of-pocket costs
Your out-of-pocket costs include the payments listed below (as long as they are for
Part D covered drugs and you followed the rules for drug coverage that are explained
in Chapter 5):
The amount you pay for drugs when you are in any of the following drug
payment stages:
The Deductible Stage
The Initial Coverage Stage
Any payments you made during this calendar year as a member of a different
Medicare prescription drug plan before you joined our plan.
It matters who pays:
If you make these payments yourself, they are included in your out-of-pocket
costs.
These payments are also included if they are made on your behalf by certain
other individuals or organizations. This includes payments for your drugs
made by a friend or relative, by most charities, by AIDS drug assistance
programs, or by the Indian Health Service. Payments made by Medicare’s
“Extra Help” Program are also included.
Some payments made by the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program are
included. The amount the manufacturer pays for your brand name drugs is
included. But the amount the plan pays for your generic drugs is not included.
Moving on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage:
When you (or those paying on your behalf) have spent a total of $7,400 in
out-of-pocket costs within the calendar year, you will move from the Coverage Gap
Stage to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage.
These payments are not included in your out-of-pocket costs
Your out-of-pocket costs do not include any of these types of payments:
Your monthly premium.
Drugs you buy outside the United States and its territories.
Drugs that are not covered by our plan.
Drugs you get at an out-of-network pharmacy that do not meet the plan’s
requirements for out-of-network coverage.
Payments you make toward prescription drugs not normally covered in a
Medicare Prescription Drug Plan.
Payments made by the plan for your brand or generic drugs while in the
Coverage Gap.
Payments for your drugs that are made by group health plans including
employer health plans.
Payments for your drugs that are made by certain insurance plans and
government-funded health programs such as TRICARE and the Veterans
Affairs.
Payments for your drugs made by a third-party with a legal obligation to pay
for prescription costs (for example, Workers’ Compensation).
Reminder: If any other organization such as the ones listed above pays part or all of
your out-of-pocket costs for drugs, you are required to tell our plan by calling Customer
Service.
How can you keep track of your out-of-pocket total?
We will help you. The Part D EOB report you receive includes the current
amount of your out-of-pocket costs. When this amount reaches $7,400, this
report will tell you that you have left the Coverage Gap Stage and have moved
on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage.
Make sure we have the information we need. Section 3.2 tells what you can
do to help make sure that our records of what you have spent are complete
and up to date.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 What you pay for a drug depends on which “drug
payment stage” you are in when you get the drug

*Section 2.1 What are the drug payment stages for Blue Cross MedicareRx
Basic (PDP) members?
There are four “drug payment stages” for your prescription drug coverage under Blue
Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP). How much you pay depends on which of these stages
you are in at the time you get a prescription filled or refilled. Keep in mind you are
always responsible for the plan’s monthly premium regardless of the drug payment
stage. Details of each stage are in Sections 4 through 7 of this chapter. The stages are:
Stage 1: Yearly Deductible Stage
Stage 2: Initial Coverage Stage
Stage 3: Coverage Gap Stage
Stage 4: Catastrophic Coverage Stage
Important Message About What You Pay for Insulin
You won’t pay more than $35 for a one-month supply of each insulin product covered
by our plan, no matter what cost-sharing tier it’s on, even if you haven’t paid your
deductible.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 We send you reports that explain payments for your
drugs and which payment stage you are in

*Section 3.1 We send you a monthly summary called the “Part D Explanation
of Benefits” (the “Part D EOB”)
Our plan keeps track of the costs of your prescription drugs and the payments you
have made when you get your prescriptions filled or refilled at the pharmacy. This
way, we can tell you when you have moved from one drug payment stage to the next.
In particular, there are two types of costs we keep track of:
We keep track of how much you have paid. This is called your "out-of-pocket"
cost.
We keep track of your "total drug costs." This is the amount you pay
out-of-pocket or others pay on your behalf plus the amount paid by the plan.
If you have had one or more prescriptions filled through the plan during the previous
month we will send you a Part D Explanation of Benefits (“Part D EOB”). The Part D EOB
includes:
Information for that month. This report gives the payment details about
the prescriptions you have filled during the previous month. It shows the
total drugs costs, what the plan paid, and what you and others on your behalf
paid.
Totals for the year since January 1. This is called "year-to-date" information.
It shows the total drug costs and total payments for your drugs since the year
began.
Drug price information. This information will display the total drug price,
and information about increases in price from first fill for each prescription
claim of the same quantity.
Available lower cost alternative prescriptions. This will include information
about available drugs with lower cost sharing for each prescription claim.

*Section 3.2 Help us keep our information about your drug payments up to
date
To keep track of your drug costs and the payments you make for drugs, we use records
we get from pharmacies. Here is how you can help us keep your information correct
and up to date:
Show your membership card every time you get a prescription filled.
This helps us make sure we know about the prescriptions you are filling and
what you are paying.
Make sure we have the information we need. There are times you may
pay for the entire cost of a prescription drug. In these cases we will not
automatically get the information we need to keep track of your out-of-pocket
costs. To help us keep track of your out-of-pocket costs, give us copies of
these receipts. Here are examples of when you should give us copies of your
drug receipts:
When you purchase a covered drug at a network pharmacy at a special
price or using a discount card that is not part of our plan’s benefit.
When you made a copayment for drugs that are provided under a drug
manufacturer patient assistance program.
Any time you have purchased covered drugs at out-of-network
pharmacies or other times you have paid the full price for a covered drug
under special circumstances.
If you are billed for a covered drug, you can ask our plan to pay our share
of the cost. For instructions on how to do this, go to Chapter 7, Section
2.
Send us information about the payments others have made for you.
Payments made by certain other individuals and organizations also count
toward your out-of-pocket costs. For example, payments made by an AIDS
drug assistance program (ADAP), the Indian Health Service, and most charities
count toward your out-of-pocket costs. Keep a record of these payments and
send them to us so we can track your costs.
Check the written report we send you. When you receive a "Part D EOB,"
look it over to be sure the information is complete and correct. If you think
something is missing or you have any questions, please call us at Customer
Service. Be sure to keep these reports.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 During the Deductible Stage, you pay the full cost of
your drugs
The Deductible Stage is the first payment stage for your drug coverage. You will pay
a yearly deductible of $505 on drugs. You must pay the full cost of your drugs until
you reach the plan’s deductible amount. The "full cost" is usually lower than the
normal full price of the drug, since our plan has negotiated lower costs for most drugs
at network pharmacies.
Once you have paid $505 for your drugs, you leave the Deductible Stage and move
on to the Initial Coverage Stage.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5 During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share
of your drug costs and you pay your share

*Section 5.1 What you pay for a drug depends on the drug and where you fill
your prescription
During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share of the cost of your covered
prescription drugs, and you pay your share (your copayment or coinsurance amount).
Your share of the cost will vary depending on the drug and where you fill your
prescription.
The plan has 5 Cost-Sharing Tiers
Every drug on the plan’s Drug List is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher
the cost-sharing tier number, the higher your cost for the drug:
Tier 1 Preferred Generic (Lowest Tier)
Tier 2 Generic
Tier 3 Preferred Brand
Tier 4 Non-Preferred Drug
Tier 5 Specialty Tier (Highest Tier)
To find out which cost-sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in the plan’s Drug List.
Your pharmacy choices
How much you pay for a drug depends on whether you get the drug from:
A network retail pharmacy that offers standard cost sharing
A network retail pharmacy that offers preferred cost sharing. Costs may be
less at pharmacies that offer preferred cost sharing.
A pharmacy that is not in the plan’s network. We cover prescriptions filled at
out-of-network pharmacies in only limited situations. Please see Chapter 3,
Section 2.5 to find out when we will cover a prescription filled at an
out-of-network pharmacy.
The plan’s mail-order pharmacy
For more information about these pharmacy choices and filling your prescriptions,
see Chapter 3 and the plan’s Pharmacy Directory.

*Section 5.2 A table that shows your costs for a one-month supply of a drug
During the Initial Coverage Stage, your share of the cost of a covered drug will be
either a copayment or coinsurance.
As shown in the table below, the amount of the copayment or coinsurance depends
on which tier. Sometimes the cost of the drug is lower than your copayment. In these
cases, you pay the lower price for the drug instead of the copayment.

*Section 5.3 If your doctor prescribes less than a full month’s supply, you
may not have to pay the cost of the entire month’s supply
Typically, the amount you pay for a prescription drug covers a full month’s supply.
There may be times when you or your doctor would like you to have less than a
month’s supply of a drug (for example, when you are trying a medication for the first
time). You can also ask your doctor to prescribe, and your pharmacist to dispense,
less than a full month’s supply of your drugs, if this will help you better plan refill dates
for different prescriptions.
If you receive less than a full month’s supply of certain drugs, you will not have to pay
for the full month’s supply.
If you are responsible for coinsurance, you pay a percentage of the total cost
of the drug. Since the coinsurance is based on the total cost of the drug, your
cost will be lower since the total cost for the drug will be lower.
If you are responsible for a copayment for the drug, you will only pay for the
number of days of the drug that you receive instead of a whole month. We

rate”) and multiply it by the number of days of the drug you receive.

*Section 5.4 A table that shows your costs for a long-term (up to a 90-day)
supply of a drug
For some drugs, you can get a long-term supply (also called an "extended supply"). A
long-term supply is up to a 90-day supply.
The table below shows what you pay when you get a long-term supply of a drug.
Sometimes the cost of the drug is lower than your copayment. In these cases,
you pay the lower price for the drug instead of the copayment.

*Section 5.5 You stay in the Initial Coverage Stage until your total drug costs
for the year reach $4,660
You stay in the Initial Coverage Stage until the total amount for the prescription drugs
you have filled reaches the $4,660 limit for the Initial Coverage Stage.
The Part D (EOB) that you receive will help you keep track of how much you, the plan,
and any third parties have spent on your behalf during the year. Many people do not
reach the $4,660 limit in a year.
We will let you know if you reach this $4,660 amount. If you do reach this amount,
you will leave the Initial Coverage Stage and move on to the Coverage Gap Stage. See
Section 1.3 on how Medicare calculates your out-of-pocket costs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6 Costs in the Coverage Gap Stage
When you are in the Coverage Gap Stage, the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount
Program provides manufacturer discounts on brand name drugs. You pay 25% of the
negotiated price and a portion of the dispensing fee for brand name drugs. Both the
amount you pay and the amount discounted by the manufacturer count toward your
out-of-pocket costs as if you had paid them and move you through the coverage gap.
You also receive some coverage for generic drugs. You pay no more than 25% of the
cost for generic drugs and the plan pays the rest. Only the amount you pay counts
and moves you through the coverage gap.
You continue paying these costs until your yearly out-of-pocket payments reach a
maximum amount that Medicare has set. Once you reach this amount $7,400, you
leave the Coverage Gap Stage and move to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage.
Medicare has rules about what counts and what does not count as your out-of-pocket
costs (Section 1.3).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 7 During the Catastrophic Coverage Stage, the plan pays
most of the cost for your drugs
You enter the Catastrophic Coverage Stage when your out-of-pocket costs have reached
the $7,400 limit for the calendar year. Once you are in the Catastrophic Coverage
Stage, you will stay in this payment stage until the end of the calendar year.
During this stage, the plan will pay most of the cost for your drugs. You will pay:
Option 1:
Your share of the cost for a covered drug will be either coinsurance or a
copayment, whichever is the larger amount:
– either – Coinsurance of 5% of the cost of the drug
–or – $4.15 for a generic drug or a drug that is treated like a generic and
$10.35 for all other drugs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 8 Part D Vaccines. What you pay for depends on how and
where you get them
Important Message About What You Pay for Vaccines
Our plan covers most Part D vaccines at no cost to you, even if you haven’t paid your
deductible. Call Customer Service for more information.
There are two parts to our coverage of Part D vaccinations:
The first part of coverage is the cost of the vaccine itself.
The second part of coverage is for the cost of giving you the vaccine. (This
is sometimes called the “administration” of the vaccine.)
Your costs for a Part D vaccination depend on three things:
1. The type of vaccine (what you are being vaccinated for).
Some vaccines are considered medical benefits. (See the Medical Benefits
Chart (what is covered and what you pay) in Chapter 4).
Other vaccines are considered Part D drugs. You can find these vaccines
listed in the plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary).
2. Where you get the vaccine.
The vaccine itself may be dispensed by a pharmacy or provided by the
doctor’s office.
3. Who gives you the vaccine.
A pharmacist may give the vaccine in the pharmacy or another provider
may give it in the doctor’s office.
What you pay at the time you get the Part D vaccination can vary depending on the
circumstances and what Drug Stage you are in.
Sometimes when you get a vaccination, you have to pay for the entire cost
for both the vaccine itself and the cost for the provider to give you the vaccine.
You can ask our plan to pay you back for our share of the cost.
Other times, when you get a vaccination, you will pay only your share of the
cost under your Part D benefit.
Below are three examples of ways you might get a Part D vaccine.
Situation 1: You get your vaccination at the network pharmacy. (Whether you have
this choice depends on where you live. Some states do not allow
pharmacies to give vaccines.)
You will pay the pharmacy your coinsurance or copayment
for the vaccine itself which includes the cost of giving you the
vaccine.
Our plan will pay the remainder of the costs.
Situation 2: You get the Part D vaccination at your doctor’s office.
When you get the vaccine, you will pay for the entire cost of
the vaccine itself and the cost for the provider to give it to
you.
You can then ask our plan to pay our share of the cost by
using the procedures that are described in Chapter 5.
You will be reimbursed the amount you paid less your normal
coinsurance or copayment for the vaccine (including
administration) less any difference between the amount the
doctor charges and what we normally pay. (If you get “Extra
Help,” we will reimburse you for this difference.)
Situation 3: You buy the Part D vaccine itself at your pharmacy, and then take it
to your doctor’s office where they give you the vaccine.
You will have to pay the pharmacy your coinsurance or
copayment for the vaccine itself.
When your doctor gives you the vaccine, you will pay the
entire cost for this service. You can then ask our plan to pay
our share of the cost by using the procedures described in
Chapter 5 of this booklet.
You will be reimbursed the amount charged by the doctor
for administering the vaccine less any difference between
the amount the doctor charges and what we normally pay.
(If you get “Extra Help,” we will reimburse you for this
difference.)
