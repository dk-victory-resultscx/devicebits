SECTION 2 Fill your prescription at a network pharmacy or through
the plan’s mail-order service

*Section 2.1 Use a network pharmacy
In most cases, your prescriptions are covered only if they are filled at the plan’s network
pharmacies. (See Section 2.5 for information about when we would cover prescriptions
filled at out-of-network pharmacies.)
A network pharmacy is a pharmacy that has a contract with the plan to provide your
covered prescription drugs. The term “covered drugs” means all of the Part D
prescription drugs that are on the plan’s Drug List.

*Section 2.2 Network pharmacies
How do you find a network pharmacy in your area?
To find a network pharmacy, you can look in your Pharmacy Directory, visit our website
(getbluenm.com/pdp), and/or call Customer Service.
You may go to any of our network pharmacies. Some of our network pharmacies
provide preferred cost sharing, which may be lower than the cost sharing at a pharmacy
that offers standard cost sharing. The Pharmacy Directory will tell you which of the
network pharmacies offer preferred cost sharing. The Pharmacy Directory will tell you
which of the network pharmacies offer preferred cost sharing. Contact us to find out
more about how your out-of-pocket costs could vary for different drugs.
What if the pharmacy you have been using leaves the network?
If the pharmacy you have been using leaves the plan’s network, you will have to find
a new pharmacy that is in the network. Or if the pharmacy you have been using stays
within the network but is no longer offering preferred cost sharing, you may want to
switch to a different network or preferred pharmacy,if available. To find another
pharmacy in your area, you can get help from Customer Service or use the Pharmacy
Directory. You can also find information on our website at getbluenm.com/pdp.
What if you need a specialized pharmacy?
Some prescriptions must be filled at a specialized pharmacy. Specialized pharmacies
include:
Pharmacies that supply drugs for home infusion therapy.
Pharmacies that supply drugs for residents of a long-term care (LTC) facility.
Usually, a LTC facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy. If you
have any difficulty accessing your Part D benefits in an LTC facility, please
contact Customer Service.
Pharmacies that serve the Indian Health Service / Tribal / Urban Indian Health
Program (not available in Puerto Rico). Except in emergencies, only Native
Americans or Alaska Natives have access to these pharmacies in our network.
Pharmacies that dispense drugs that are restricted by the FDA to certain
locations or that require special handling, provider coordination, or education
on their use. (Note: This scenario should happen rarely.)
To locate a specialized pharmacy, look in your Pharmacy Directory or call Customer
Service.

*Section 2.3 Using the plan’s mail-order service
Our plan’s mail-order service allows you to order up to a 90-day supply.
To get information about filling your prescriptions by mail, contact one of our
mail-order services: AllianceRx Walgreens Pharmacy at 1-888-277-5475 (TTY 711), or
Express Scripts® Pharmacy at 1-833-715-0944 (TTY 711). You can also visit www.
alliancerxwp.com/home-delivery or express-scripts.com/rx.
See Chapter 4, Sections 5.2 and 5.4 for preferred and standard cost-sharing amounts
at mail-order pharmacies.
Usually a mail-order pharmacy order will be delivered to you in no more than 10 days.
To refill your mail order prescriptions, please contact us 10 to 20 days before you
think the drugs you have on hand will run out to make sure your next order is shipped
to you in time.
If a mail-order delay exists and you are in jeopardy of therapy interruption,
your plan allows for mail delay override. Please call Customer Service to get
an override approval. Once approval is received, the mail-order pharmacy
will transfer your prescription to the pharmacy of your choice or have your
prescriber telephone a shorter supply to a local retail pharmacy.
New prescriptions the pharmacy receives directly from your doctor’s office.
The pharmacy will automatically fill and deliver new prescriptions it receives from
health care providers, without checking with you first, if either:
You used mail-order services with this plan in the past, or
You sign up for automatic delivery of all new prescriptions received directly
from health care providers. You may request automatic delivery of all new
prescriptions at any time by contacting your mail order pharmacy to set up
automatic refills for your prescriptions.
If you receive a prescription automatically by mail that you do not want, and you
were not contacted to see if you wanted it before it shipped, you may be eligible
for a refund.
If you used mail order in the past and do not want the pharmacy to automatically
fill and ship each new prescription, please contact us by logging into your online
account or by contacting the pharmacy directly.
If you have never used our mail-order delivery and/or decide to stop automatic fills
of new prescriptions, the pharmacy will contact you each time it gets a new prescription
from a health care provider to see if you want the medication filled and shipped
immediately. It is important that you respond each time you are contacted by the
pharmacy, to let them know whether to ship, delay, or cancel the new prescription.
Refills on mail-order prescriptions. For refills of your drugs, you have the option
to sign up for an automatic refill program. Under this program we will start to
process your next refill automatically when our records show you should be close
to running out of your drug. The pharmacy will contact you prior to shipping each
refill to make sure you are in need of more medication, and you can cancel
scheduled refills if you have enough of your medication or if your medication has
changed.
If you choose not to use our auto-refill program but still want the mail-order
pharmacy to send you your prescription, please contact your pharmacy 10 days
days before your current prescription will run out. This will ensure your order is
shipped to you in time.
To opt out of our program that automatically prepares mail-order refills, please
contact us by logging into your online account or by contacting the pharmacy
directly.
If you receive a refill automatically by mail that you do not want, you may be eligible
for a refund.

*Section 2.4 How can you get a long-term supply of drugs?
The plan offers two ways to get a long-term supply (also called an “extended supply”)
of “maintenance” drugs on our plan’s Drug List. (Maintenance drugs are drugs that
you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or long-term medical condition.)
1. Some retail pharmacies in our network allow you to get a long-term supply
of maintenance drugs. Your Pharmacy Directory tells you which pharmacies
in our network can give you a long-term supply of maintenance drugs. You
can also call Customer Service for more information.
2. You may also receive maintenance drugs through our mail-order program.
Please see Section 2.3 for more information.

*Section 2.5 When can you use a pharmacy that is not in the plan’s network?
Your prescription may be covered in certain situations
Generally, we cover drugs filled at an out-of-network pharmacy only when you are
not able to use a network pharmacy. To help you, we have network pharmacies outside
of our service area where you can get your prescriptions filled as a member of our
plan. Please check first with Customer Service to see if there is a network pharmacy
nearby. You will most likely be required to pay the difference between what you pay
for the drug at the out-of-network pharmacy and the cost that we would cover at an
in-network pharmacy.
Here are the circumstances when we would cover prescriptions filled at an
out-of-network pharmacy:
If the member is traveling outside his or her plan’s service area and:
he/she runs out of or loses his or her covered Part D drugs; or
becomes ill and needs a covered Part D drug; or
cannot access a network pharmacy.
If the member is unable to obtain a covered Part D drug in a timely manner
within his or her service area because, for example, there is no network
pharmacy within a reasonable driving distance that provides 24/7 service;
If the member is filling a prescription for a covered Part D drug and that
particular drug (for example, an orphan drug or other specialty
pharmaceutical) is not regularly stocked at an accessible network retail or
mail-order pharmacy;
If the member is provided with covered Part D drugs dispensed by an
out-of-network institution-based pharmacy while the beneficiary is in an
emergency department, provider-based clinic, outpatient surgery, or other
outpatient setting.
During any Federal disaster declaration or other public health emergency
declaration in which Part D enrollees are evacuated or otherwise displaced
from their place of residence and cannot reasonably be expected to obtain
covered Part D drugs at a network pharmacy. In addition, in circumstances
in which normal distribution channels are unavailable.
Refill prescriptions for routine or maintenance drugs filled at out-of-network
pharmacies in a NON-emergency situation or unusual circumstances, will
not be available for coverage under your Medicare Part D benefit.
In addition, Blue Cross MedicareRx will not routinely allow for more than a
month’s supply of medication to be dispensed at an out-of-network pharmacy,
although Blue Cross MedicareRx may override the one-month limit on a
case-by-case basis when warranted by extraordinary circumstances.
You can locate all of the Blue Cross MedicareRx participating pharmacies in
your area on our website at getbluenm.com/pdp/pharmacies or by calling
the Pharmacy Locator line at 1-877-800-0746, answered 24 hours a day, 365
days a year. TTY users call 711, answered 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
How do you ask for reimbursement from the plan?
If you must use an out-of-network pharmacy, you will generally have to pay the full
cost (rather than your normal cost share) at the time you fill your prescription. You
can ask us to reimburse you for our share of the cost. (Chapter 5, Section 2 explains
how to ask the plan to pay you back.)
