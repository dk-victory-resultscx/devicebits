SECTION 1 Introduction to ending your membership in our plan
Ending your membership in Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) may be voluntary
(your own choice) or involuntary (not your own choice):
You might leave our plan because you have decided that you want to leave.
Sections 2 and 3 provide information on ending your membership voluntarily.
There are also limited situations where we are required to end your
membership. Section 5 tells you about situations when we must end your
membership.
If you are leaving our plan, our plan must continue to provide your prescription drugs
and you will continue to pay your cost share until your membership ends.
