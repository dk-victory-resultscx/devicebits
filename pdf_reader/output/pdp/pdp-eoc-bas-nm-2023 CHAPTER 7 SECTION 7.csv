*Section 7.2 How to make a complaint
Legal Terms
A “Complaint” is also called a “grievance.”
“Making a complaint” is also called “filing a grievance.”
“Using the process for complaints” is also called “using the process for
filing a grievance."
A “fast complaint” is also called an “expedited grievance.”

*Section 7.3 Step-by-step: Making a complaint
Step 1: Contact us promptly – either by phone or in writing.
Usually, calling Customer Service is the first step. If there is anything else
you need to do, Customer Service will let you know.
If you do not wish to call (or you called and were not satisfied), you can
put your complaint in writing and send it to us. If you put your complaint
in writing, we will respond to your complaint in writing.
Grievances received verbally will be responded to in writing, unless you
request a verbal response.
Although we may verbally contact you to discuss your grievance and/or the
resolution, grievances received in writing will be responded to in writing.
Grievances related to quality of care, regardless of how the grievance is filed,
will be responded to in writing, including a description of your right to file a
written complaint with the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO).
All grievances (verbal and written), will be responded to within the following
timeframes:
Standard Grievances (any complaint other than an expedited grievance
defined above) will be responded to as expeditiously as your case
requires, based on your health status, but no later than 30 days after
receipt of your grievance. Blue Cross MedicareRx Plus (PDP) may extend
the 30-day timeframe by up to 14 days if either you request the extension
or if Blue Cross MedicareRx Plus (PDP) determines additional information
is needed and that the delay is in your best interest. If there is a delay,
Blue Cross MedicareRx Plus (PDP) will notify you in writing of the reason
for the delay.
Expedited Grievances may only be filed if Blue Cross MedicareRx Plus
(PDP) denies your request for an expedited coverage determination or
expedited redetermination. Expedited Grievances will be responded to
within 24 hours.
The deadline for making a complaint is 60 calendar days from the time you
had the problem you want to complain about.
Step 2: We look into your complaint and give you our answer.
If possible, we will answer you right away. If you call us with a complaint,
we may be able to give you an answer on the same phone call.
Most complaints are answered within 30 calendar days. If we need more
information and the delay is in your best interest or if you ask for more time,
we can take up to 14 more calendar days (44 calendar days total) to answer
your complaint. If we decide to take extra days, we will tell you in writing.
If you are making a complaint because we denied your request for a
“fast coverage decision” or a “fast appeal,” we will automatically give
you a “fast complaint.” If you have a “fast complaint,” it means we will give
you an answer within 24 hours.
If we do not agree with some or all of your complaint or don’t take
responsibility for the problem you are complaining about, we will include our
reasons in our response to you.

*Section 7.4 You can also make complaints about quality of care to the
Quality Improvement Organization
When your complaint is about quality of care, you also have two extra options:
You can make your complaint directly to the Quality Improvement
Organization. The Quality Improvement Organization is a group of practicing
doctors and other health care experts paid by the Federal government to
check and improve the care given to Medicare patients. Chapter 2 has contact
information.
Or
You can make your complaint to both the Quality Improvement
Organization and us at the same time.

*Section 7.5 You can also tell Medicare about your complaint
You can submit a complaint about Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) directly to
Medicare. To submit a complaint to Medicare, go to www.medicare.gov/
MedicareComplaintForm/home.aspx. You may also call 1-800-MEDICARE
(1-800-633-4227). TTY/TDD users can call 1-877-486-2048.
