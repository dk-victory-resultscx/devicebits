SECTION 1 Situations in which you should ask us to pay our share
of the cost of your covered drugs
Sometimes when you get a prescription drug, you may need to pay the full cost. Other
times, you may find that you have paid more than you expected under the coverage
rules of the plan or you may receive a bill from a provider. In these cases, you can ask
our plan to pay you back (paying you back is often called “reimbursing” you). There
may be deadlines that you must meet to get paid back. Please see Section 2 of this
chapter.
Here are examples of situations in which you may need to ask our plan to pay you
back. All of these examples are types of coverage decisions (for more information
about coverage decisions, go to Chapter 7).
1. When you use an out-of-network pharmacy to get a prescription filled
If you go to an out-of-network pharmacy, the pharmacy may not be able to submit
the claim directly to us. When that happens, you will have to pay the full cost of
your prescription.
Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our
share of the cost. Remember that we only cover out of network pharmacies in
limited circumstances. See Chapter 3, Section 2.5 for a discussion of these
circumstances.
2. When you pay the full cost for a prescription because you don’t have your
plan membership card with you
If you do not have your plan membership card with you, you can ask the pharmacy
to call the plan or look up your enrollment information. However, if the pharmacy
cannot get the enrollment information they need right away, you may need to pay
the full cost of the prescription yourself.
Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our
share of the cost.
3. When you pay the full cost for a prescription in other situations
You may pay the full cost of the prescription because you find that the drug is not
covered for some reason.
For example, the drug may not be on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs
(Formulary); or it could have a requirement or restriction that you didn’t know
about or don’t think should apply to you. If you decide to get the drug
immediately, you may need to pay the full cost for it.
Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back. In
some situations, we may need to get more information from your doctor in
order to pay you back for our share of the cost.
4. If you are retroactively enrolled in our plan
Sometimes a person’s enrollment in the plan is retroactive. (This means that the
first day of their enrollment has already passed. The enrollment date may even
have occurred last year.)
If you were retroactively enrolled in our plan and you paid out-of-pocket for any
of your drugs after your enrollment date, you can ask us to pay you back for our
share of the costs. You will need to submit paperwork for us to handle the
reimbursement.
All of the examples above are types of coverage decisions. This means that if we deny
your request for payment, you can appeal our decision. Chapter 7 of this document
has information about how to make an appeal.
