SECTION 1 Introduction

*Section 1.1 You are enrolled in Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP), which is
a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan
You are covered by Original Medicare or another health plan for your health care
coverage, and you have chosen to get your Medicare prescription drug coverage
through our plan, Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP). We are required to cover all
Part A and Part B services. However, cost sharing and provider access in this plan
differ from Original Medicare.
Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) is a Medicare prescription drug plan (PDP). Like
all Medicare plans, this Medicare prescription drug plan is approved by Medicare and
run by a private company.

*Section 1.2 What is the Evidence of Coverage document about?
This Evidence of Coverage document tells you how to get your prescription drugs. It
explains your rights and responsibilities, what is covered, what you pay as a member
of the plan, and how to file a complaint if you are not satisfied with a decision or
treatment.
The word “coverage” and “covered drugs” refers to the prescription drug coverage
available to you as a member of Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP).
It’s important for you to learn what the plan’s rules are and what coverage is available
to you. We encourage you to set aside some time to look through this Evidence of
Coverage document.
If you are confused, concerned or just have a question, please contact Customer
Service.

*Section 1.3 Legal information about the Evidence of Coverage
This Evidence of Coverage is part of our contract with you about how Blue Cross
MedicareRx Basic (PDP) covers your care. Other parts of this contract include your
enrollment form, the List of Covered Drugs (Formulary), and any notices you receive
from us about changes to your coverage or conditions that affect your coverage. These
notices are sometimes called “riders” or “amendments.”
The contract is in effect for months in which you are enrolled in Blue Cross MedicareRx
Basic (PDP) between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023.
Each calendar year, Medicare allows us to make changes to the plans that we offer.
This means we can change the costs and benefits of Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic
(PDP) after December 31, 2023. We can also choose to stop offering the plan, in your
service area, after December 31, 2023.
Medicare (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) must approve Blue Cross
MedicareRx Basic (PDP) each year. You can continue each year to get Medicare
coverage as a member of our plan as long as we choose to continue to offer the plan
and Medicare renews its approval of the plan.
