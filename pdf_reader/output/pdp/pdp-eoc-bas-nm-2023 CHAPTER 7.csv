CHAPTER 7:
What to do if you have a problem
or complaint
(coverage decisions, appeals,
complaints)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 Introduction

*Section 1.1 What to do if you have a problem or concern
This chapter explains two types of processes for handling problems and concerns:
For some problems, you need to use the process for coverage decisions
and appeals.
For other problems, you need to use the process for making complaints;
also called grievances
Both of these processes have been approved by Medicare. Each process has a set of
rules, procedures, and deadlines that must be followed by us and by you.
The guide in Section 3 will help you identify the right process to use and what you
should do.

*Section 1.2 What about the legal terms?
There are legal terms for some of the rules, procedures, and types of deadlines
explained in this chapter. Many of these terms are unfamiliar to most people and can
be hard to understand. To make things easier, this chapter:
Uses simpler words in place of certain legal terms. For example, this chapter
generally says “making a complaint” rather than “filing a grievance,” “coverage
decision” rather than “coverage determination” or “at-risk determination,”
and “independent review organization” instead of “Independent Review Entity.”
It also uses abbreviations as little as possible.
However, it can be helpful – and sometimes quite important – for you to know the
correct legal terms. Knowing which terms to use will help you communicate more
accurately to get the right help or information for your situation. To help you know
which terms to use, we include legal terms when we give the details for handling
specific types of situations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 Where to get more information and personalized
assistance
We are always available to help you. Even if you have a complaint about our treatment
of you, we are obligated to honor your right to complain. Therefore, you should always
reach out to customer service for help. But in some situations you may also want help
or guidance from someone who is not connected with us. Below are two entities that
can assist you.
State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)
Each state has a government program with trained counselors. The program is not
connected with us or with any insurance company or health plan. The counselors at
this program can help you understand which process you should use to handle a
problem you are having. They can also answer your questions, give you more
information, and offer guidance on what to do.
The services of SHIP counselors are free. You will find phone and website URLs
numbers in Chapter 2, Section 3 of this document.
Medicare
You can also contact Medicare to get help. To contact Medicare:
You can call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.
You can also visit the Medicare website (www.medicare.gov).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 To deal with your problem, which process should you
use?
If you have a problem or concern, you only need to read the parts of this chapter that
apply to your situation. The guide that follows will help.
Is your problem or concern about your benefits or coverage?
(This includes problems about whether medical care or prescription drugs are
covered or not, the way they are covered, and problems related to payment for
medical care or prescription drugs.)
Yes.
Go on to the next section of this chapter, Section 4, “A guide to the basics
of coverage decisions and appeals.”
No.
Skip ahead to Section 7 at the end of this chapter: “How to make a complaint
about quality of care, waiting times, customer service or other concerns.”
COVERAGE DECISIONS AND APPEALS

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 A guide to the basics of coverage decisions and appeals

*Section 4.1 Asking for coverage decisions and making appeals: the big picture
Coverage decisions and appeals deal with problems related to your benefits and
coverage for prescription drugs, including payments. This is the process you use for
issues such as whether a drug is covered or not and the way in which the drug is
covered.
Asking for coverage decisions prior to receiving services
A coverage decision is a decision we make about your coverage or about the amount
we will pay for your prescription drugs.
We are making a coverage decision for you whenever we decide what is covered for
you and how much we pay. In some cases, we might decide a drug is not covered or
is no longer covered by Medicare for you. If you disagree with this coverage decision,
you can make an appeal.
Making an appeal
If we make a coverage decision, whether before or after a service is received, and you
are not satisfied, you can “appeal” the decision. An appeal is a formal way of asking
us to review and change a coverage decision we have made. Under certain
circumstances, which we discuss later, you can request an expedited or “fast appeal”
of a coverage decision. Your appeal is handled by different reviewers than those who
made the original decision.
When you appeal a decision for the first time, this is called a Level 1 appeal. In this
appeal, we review the coverage decision we made to check to see if we were properly
following the rules. When we have completed the review, we give you our decision.
In limited circumstances a request for Level 1 appeal will be dismissed, which means
we won’t review the request. Examples of when a request will be dismissed include
if the request is incomplete, if someone makes the request on your behalf but isn’t
legally authorized to do so or if you ask for your request to be withdrawn. If we dismiss
a request for a Level 1 appeal, we will send a notice explaining why the request was
dismissed and how to ask for a review of the dismissal.
If we do not dismiss your case but say no to all or part of your Level 1 appeal, you can
go on to a Level 2 appeal. The Level 2 appeal is conducted by an independent review
organization that is not connected to us. Appeals for medical services and Part B drugs
will be automatically sent to the independent review organization for a Level 2 appeal
- you do not need to do anything. For Part D drug appeals, if we say no to all or part
of your appeal you will need to ask for a Level 2 appeal. Part D appeals are discussed
further in Section 6 of this chapter. If you are not satisfied with the decision at the
Level 2 appeal, you may be able to continue through additional levels of appeal (Section
9 in this chapter explains the Level 3, 4, and 5 appeals processes).

*Section 4.2 How to get help when you are asking for a coverage decision or
making an appeal
Here are resources if you decide to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a
decision:
You can call us at Customer Service.
You can get free help from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program.
Your doctor or other prescriber can make a request for you. For Part D
prescription drugs, your doctor or other prescriber can request a coverage
decision or a Level 1 appeal on your behalf. If your Level 1 appeal is denied
your doctor or prescriber can request a Level 2 appeal.
You can ask someone to act on your behalf. If you want to, you can name
another person to act for you as your “representative” to ask for a coverage
decision or make an appeal.
If you want a friend, relative, or other person to be your representative,
call Customer Service and ask for the “Appointment of Representative”
form. (The form is also available on Medicare’s website at www.cms.gov/
Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf or on our
website at getbluenm.com/pdp.) The form gives that person permission
to act on your behalf. It must be signed by you and by the person who
you would like to act on your behalf. You must give us a copy of the
signed form.
While we can accept an appeal request without the form, we cannot
begin or complete our review until we receive it. If we do not receive the
form within 44 calendar days after receiving your appeal request (our
deadline for making a decision on your appeal), your appeal request will
be dismissed. If this happens, we will send you a written notice explaining
your right to ask the independent review organization to review our
decision to dismiss your appeal.
You also have the right to hire a lawyer. You may contact your own lawyer,
or get the name of a lawyer from your local bar association or other referral
service. There are also groups that will give you free legal services if you
qualify. However, you are not required to hire a lawyer to ask for any kind
of coverage decision or appeal a decision.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5 Your Part D prescription drugs: How to ask for a
coverage decision or make an appeal

*Section 5.1 This section tells you what to do if you have problems getting a
Part D drug or you want us to pay you back for a Part D drug
Your benefits include coverage for many prescription drugs. To be covered, the drug
must be used for a medically accepted indication. (See Chapter 5 for more information
about a medically accepted indication.) For details about Part D drugs, rules,
restrictions, and costs please see Chapters 5 and 6.
This section is about your Part D drugs only. To keep things simple, we
generally say “drug” in the rest of this section, instead of repeating “covered
outpatient prescription drug” or “Part D drug” every time. We also use the
term “drug list” instead of “List of Covered Drugs” or “Formulary.”
If you do not know if a drug is covered or if you meet the rules, you can ask
us. Some drugs require that you get approval from us before we will cover
it.
If your pharmacy tells you that your prescription cannot be filled as written,
the pharmacy will give you a written notice explaining how to contact us to
ask for a coverage decision.
Part D coverage decisions and appeals
Legal Terms
An initial coverage decision about your Part D drugs is called a “coverage
determination.”
A coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about
the amount we will pay for your drugs. This section tells what you can do if you are
in any of the following situations:
Asking to cover a Part D drug that is not on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs.
Ask for an exception. Section 5.2
Asking to waive a restriction on the plan’s coverage for a drug (such as limits
on the amount of the drug you can get) Ask for an exception. Section 5.2
Asking to pay a lower cost-sharing amount for a covered drug on a higher
cost-sharing tier Ask for an exception. Section 5.2
Asking to get pre-approval for a drug. Ask for a coverage decision. Section
5.4
Pay for a prescription drug you already bought. Ask us to pay you back.

*Section 5.4
If you disagree with a coverage decision we have made, you can appeal our decision.
This section tells you both how to ask for coverage decisions and how to request an
appeal.

*Section 5.2 What is an exception?
Legal Terms
Asking for coverage of a drug that is not on the Drug List is sometimes called asking
for a “formulary exception.”
Asking for removal of a restriction on coverage for a drug is sometimes called asking
for a “formulary exception.”
Asking to pay a lower price for a covered non-preferred drug is sometimes called
asking for a “tiering exception.”
If a drug is not covered in the way you would like it to be covered, you can ask us to
make an “exception.” An exception is a type of coverage decision.
For us to consider your exception request, your doctor or other prescriber will need
to explain the medical reasons why you need the exception approved. Here are three
examples of exceptions that you or your doctor or other prescriber can ask us to
make:
1. Covering a Part D drug for you that is not on our Drug List. If we agree to
cover a drug not on the Drug List, you will need to pay the cost-sharing amount
that applies to drugs in Tier 4. You cannot ask for an exception to the copayment
or coinsurance amount we require you to pay for the drug.
2. Removing a restriction for a covered drug. Chapter 3 describes the extra rules
or restrictions that apply to certain drugs on our Drug List. If we agree to make
an exception and waive a restriction for you, you can ask for an exception to the
copayment or coinsurance amount we require you to pay for the drug.
3. Changing coverage of a drug to a lower cost-sharing tier. Every drug on our
Drug List is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the lower the cost-sharing
tier number, the less you will pay as your share of the cost of the drug.
If our drug list contains alternative drug(s) for treating your medical condition
that are in a lower cost-sharing tier than your drug, you can ask us to cover
your drug at the cost-sharing amount that applies to the alternative drug(s).
If the drug you’re taking is a biological product you can ask us to cover your
drug at a lower cost-sharing. This would be the lowest tier cost that contains
biological product alternatives for treating your condition.
If the drug you’re taking is a brand name drug you can ask us to cover your
drug at the cost-sharing amount that applies to the lowest tier that contains
brand name alternatives for treating your condition.
If the drug you’re taking is a generic drug you can ask us to cover your drug
at the cost-sharing amount that applies to the lowest tier that contains either
brand or generic alternatives for treating your condition.
You cannot ask us to change the cost-sharing tier for any drug in Tier 5
(Specialty).
If we approve your tiering exception request and there is more than one
lower cost-sharing tier with alternative drugs you can’t take, you will usually
pay the lowest amount.

*Section 5.3 Important things to know about asking for exceptions
Your doctor must tell us the medical reasons
Your doctor or other prescriber must give us a statement that explains the medical
reasons for requesting an exception. For a faster decision, include this medical
information from your doctor or other prescriber when you ask for the exception.
Typically, our Drug List includes more than one drug for treating a particular condition.
These different possibilities are called “alternative” drugs. If an alternative drug would
be just as effective as the drug you are requesting and would not cause more side
effects or other health problems, we will generally not approve your request for an
exception. If you ask us for a tiering exception, we will generally not approve your
request for an exception unless all the alternative drugs in the lower cost-sharing
tier(s) won’t work as well for you or are likely to cause an adverse reaction or other
harm.
We can say yes or no to your request
If we approve your request for an exception, our approval usually is valid
until the end of the plan year. This is true as long as your doctor continues
to prescribe the drug for you and that drug continues to be safe and effective
for treating your condition.
If we say no to your request, you can ask for another review by making an
appeal.

*Section 5.4 Step-by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision, including an
exception
Legal Terms
A “fast coverage decision” is called an “expedited coverage determination.”
Step 1: Decide if you need a “standard coverage decision” or a “fast coverage
decision.”
“Standard coverage decisions” are made within 72 hours after we receive your
doctor’s statement. “Fast coverage decisions” are made within 24 hours after we
receive your doctor’s statement.
If your health requires it, ask us to give you a “fast coverage decision.”To get a fast
coverage decision, you must meet two requirements:
You must be asking for a drug you have not yet received. (You cannot ask for
fast coverage decision to be paid back for a drug you have already bought.)
Using the standard deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt
your ability to function.
If your doctor or other prescriber tells us that your health requires a
“fast coverage decision,” we will automatically give you a fast coverage
decision.
If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor
or prescriber’s support, we will decide whether your health requires
that we give you a fast coverage decision. If we do not approve a fast
coverage decision, we will send you a letter that:
Explains that we will use the standard deadlines.
Explains if your doctor or other prescriber asks for the fast coverage
decision, we will automatically give you a fast coverage decision.
Tells you how you can file a “fast complaint” about our decision to give
you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision
you requested. We will answer your complaint within 24 hours of receipt.
Step 2: Request a “standard coverage decision” or a “fast coverage decision.”
Start by calling, writing, or faxing our plan to make your request for us to authorize
or provide coverage for the medical care you want. You can also access the coverage
decision process through our website. We must accept any written request, including
a request submitted on the CMS Model Coverage Determination Request Form, which
is available on our website. Chapter 2 has contact information. To assist us in
processing your request, please be sure to include your name, contact information,
and information identifying which denied claim is being appealed.
You, your doctor, (or other prescriber) or your representative can do this. You can
also have a lawyer act on your behalf. Section 4 of this chapter tells how you can give
written permission to someone else to act as your representative.
If you are requesting an exception, provide the “supporting statement,”
Which is the medical reasons for the exception. Your doctor or other
prescriber can fax or mail the statement to us. Or your doctor or other
prescriber can tell us on the phone and follow up by faxing or mailing a written
statement if necessary.
Step 3: We consider your request and give you our answer.
Deadlines for a “fast coverage decision”
We must generally give you our answer within 24 hours after we receive your
request.
For exceptions, we will give you our answer within 24 hours after we
receive your doctor’s supporting statement. We will give you our answer
sooner if your health requires us to.
If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request
on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an
independent review organization.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must provide
the coverage we have agreed to provide within 24 hours after we receive
your request or doctor’s statement supporting your request.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no. We will also tell you how
you can appeal.
Deadlines for a “standard” coverage decision about a drug you have not yet received
We must generally give you our answer within72 hours after we receive your
request.
For exceptions, we will give you our answer within 72 hours after we
receive your doctor’s supporting statement. We will give you our answer
sooner if your health requires us to.
If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request
on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an
independent review organization.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must provide
the coverage we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we receive
your request or doctor’s statement supporting your request.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no. We will also tell you how
you can appeal.
Deadlines for a “standard” coverage decision about payment for a drug you have
already bought
We must give you our answer within 14 calendar days after we receive your
request.
If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request
on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an
independent review organization.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we are also
required to make payment to you within 14 calendar days after we receive
your request.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no. We will also tell you how
you can appeal.
Step 4: If we say no to your coverage request, you can make an appeal.
If we say no, you have the right to ask us to reconsider this decision by making
an appeal. This means asking again to get the drug coverage you want. If you
make an appeal, it means you are going on to Level 1 of the appeals process.

*Section 5.5 Step-by-step: How to make a Level 1 appeal
Legal Terms
An appeal to the plan about a Part D drug coverage decision is called a plan
“redetermination.”
A “fast appeal” is also called an “expedited redetermination.”
Step 1: Decide if you need a “standard appeal” or a “fast appeal.”
A “standard appeal” is usually made within 7 days. A “fast appeal” is generally
made within 72 hours. If your health requires it, ask for a “fast appeal”
If you are appealing a decision we made about a drug you have not yet
received, you and your doctor or other prescriber will need to decide if you
need a “fast appeal.”
The requirements for getting a “fast appeal” are the same as those for getting
a “fast coverage decision” in Section 6.4 of this chapter.
Step 2: You, your representative, doctor, or other prescriber must contact us
and make your Level 1 appeal. If your health requires a quick response, you must
ask for a“fast appeal.”
For standard appeals, submit a written request. Chapter 2 has contact
information.
For fast appeals either submit your appeal in writing or call us at
(1-888-285-2249). Chapter 2 has contact information.
We must accept any written request, including a request submitted on
the CMS Model Coverage Determination Request Form, which is available on
our website. Please be sure to include your name, contact information, and
information regarding your claim to assist us in processing your request.
You must make your appeal request within 60 calendar days from the
date on the written notice we sent to tell you our answer on the coverage
decision. If you miss this deadline and have a good reason for missing it,
explain the reason your appeal is late when you make your appeal. We may
give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of good cause may include
a serious illness that prevented you from contacting us or if we provided you
with incorrect or incomplete information about the deadline for requesting
an appeal.
You can ask for a copy of the information in your appeal and add more
information. You and your doctor may add more information to support
your appeal. We are allowed to charge a fee for copying and sending this
information to you.
Step 3: We consider your appeal and we give you our answer.
When we are reviewing your appeal, we take another careful look at all of
the information about your coverage request. We check to see if we were
following all the rules when we said no to your request.
We may contact you or your doctor or other prescriber to get more
information.
Deadlines for a “fast appeal”
For fast appeals, we must give you our answer within 72 hours after we
receive your appeal. We will give you our answer sooner if your health
requires it.
If we do not give you an answer within 72 hours, we are required to send
your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be
reviewed by an independent review organization. Section 6.6 explains
the Level 2 appeal process.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must provide
the coverage we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we receive
your appeal.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no and how you can appeal
our decision.
Deadlines for a “standard” appeal for a drug you have not yet received
For standard appeals, we must give you our answer within 7 calendar days
after we receive your appeal. We will give you our decision sooner if you have
not received the drug yet and your health condition requires us to do so.
If we do not give you a decision within 7 calendar days, we are required
to send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will
be reviewed by an independent review organization. Section 6.6 explains
the Level 2 appeal process.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must provide
the coverage as quickly as your health requires, but no later than 7 calendar
days after we receive your appeal.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no and how you can appeal
our decision.
Deadlines for a “standard appeal” about payment for a drug you have already
bought
We must give you our answer within 14 calendar days after we receive your
request.
If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request
on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an
independent review organization.
If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we are also
required to make payment to you within 30 calendar days after we receive
your request.
If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you
a written statement that explains why we said no. We will also tell you how
you can appeal.
Step 4: If we say no to your appeal, you decide if you want to continue with the
appeals process and make another appeal.
If you decide to make another appeal, it means your appeal is going on to
Level 2 of the appeals process.

*Section 5.6 Step-by-step: How to make a Level 2 appeal
Legal Terms
The formal name for the “independent review organization” is the “Independent
Review Entity.” It is sometimes called the “IRE.”
The independent review organization is an independent organization hired by
Medicare. It is not connected with us and is not a government agency. This
organization decides whether the decision we made is correct or if it should be
changed. Medicare oversees its work.
Step 1: You (or your representative or your doctor or other prescriber) must
contact the independent review organization and ask for a review of your case.
If we say no to your Level 1 appeal, the written notice we send you will include
instructions on how to make a Level 2 appeal with the independent review
organization. These instructions will tell who can make this Level 2 appeal,
what deadlines you must follow, and how to reach the review organization.
If, however, we did not complete our review within the applicable timeframe,
or make an unfavorable decision regarding “at-risk” determination under our
drug management program, we will automatically forward your claim to the
IRE.
We will send the information we have about your appeal to this organization.
This information is called your “case file.” You have the right to ask us for
a copy of your case file. We are allowed to charge you a fee for copying and
sending this information to you.
You have a right to give the independent review organization additional
information to support your appeal.
Step 2: The independent review organization reviews your appeal.
Reviewers at the independent review organization will take a careful look at
all of the information related to your appeal.
Deadlines for “fast appeal”
If your health requires it, ask the independent review organization for a “fast
appeal.”
If the organization agrees to give you a “fast appeal,” the organization must
give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal within 72 hours after it receives
your appeal request.
Deadlines for “standard appeal”
For standard appeals, the review organization must give you an answer to
your Level 2 appeal within 7 calendar days after it receives your appeal if
it is for a drug you have not yet received. If you are requesting that we pay
you back for a drug you have already bought, the review organization must
give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal within 14 calendar days after it
receives your request
Step 3: The independent review organization gives you their answer.
For “fast appeals”:
If the independent review organization says yes to part or all of what
you requested, we must provide the drug coverage that was approved by
the review organization within 24 hours after we receive the decision from
the review organization.
For “standard appeals”:
If the independent review organization says yes to part or all of your
request for coverage, we must provide the drug coverage that was
approved by the review organization within 72 hours after we receive the
decision from the review organization.
If the independent review organization says yes to part or all of your request
to pay you back for a drug you already bought, we are required to send
payment to you within 30 calendar days after we receive the decision from
the review organization.
What if the review organization says no to your appeal?
If this organization says no to part or all of your appeal, it means they agree with
our decision not to approve your request (or part of your request). (This is called
“upholding the decision.” It is also called “turning down your appeal.”) In this case, the
independent review organization will send you a letter:
Explaining its decision.
Notifying you of the right to a Level 3 appeal if the dollar value of the drug
coverage you are requesting meets a certain minimum. If the dollar value of
the drug coverage you are requesting is too low, you cannot make another
appeal and the decision at Level 2 is final.
Telling you the dollar value that must be in dispute to continue with the
appeals process.
Step 4: If your case meets the requirements, you choose whether you want to
take your appeal further.
There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a
total of five levels of appeal).
If you want to go on to a Level 3 appeal, the details on how to do this are in
the written notice you get after your Level 2 appeal decision.
The Level 3 appeal is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney
adjudicator. Section 6 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of
the appeals process.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6 Taking your appeal to Level 3 and beyond

*Section 6.1 Appeal Levels 3, 4 and 5 for Part D Drug Requests
This section may be appropriate for you if you have made a Level 1 appeal and a Level
2 appeal, and both of your appeals have been turned down.
If the value of the drug you have appealed meets a certain dollar amount, you may
be able to go on to additional levels of appeal. If the dollar amount is less, you cannot
appeal any further. The written response you receive to your Level 2 appeal will explain
who to contact and what to do to ask for a Level 3 appeal.
For most situations that involve appeals, the last three levels of appeal work in much
the same way. Here is who handles the review of your appeal at each of these levels.
Level 3 appeal An Administrative Law Judge or an attorney adjudicator
who works for the Federal government will review your
appeal and give you an answer.
If the answer is yes, the appeals process is over. We must authorize or
provide the drug coverage that was approved by the Administrative Law
Judge or attorney adjudicator within 72 hours (24 hours for expedited
appeals) or make payment no later than 30 calendar days after we receive
the decision.
If the Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator says no to your
appeal, the appeals process may or may not be over.
If you decide to accept this decision that turns down your appeal, the
appeals process is over.
If you do not want to accept the decision, you can continue to the next
level of the review process. The notice you get will tell you what to do
for a Level 4 appeal.
Level 4 appeal The MedicareAppeals Council (Council) will review your appeal
and give you an answer. The Council is part of the Federal
government.
If the answer is yes, the appeals process is over. We must authorize or
provide the drug coverage that was approved by the Council within 72
hours (24 hours for expedited appeals) or make payment no later than
30 calendar days after we receive the decision.
If the answer is no, the appeals process may or may not be over.
If you decide to accept this decision that turns down your appeal, the
appeals process is over.
If you do not want to accept the decision, you may be able to continue
to the next level of the review process. If the Council says no to your
appeal or denies your request to review the appeal, the notice will tell
you whether the rules allow you to go on to a Level 5 appeal. It will also
tell you who to contact and what to do next if you choose to continue
with your appeal.
Level 5 appeal A judge at the Federal District Court will review your appeal.
A judge will review all of the information and decide yes or no to your request.
This is a final answer. There are no more appeal levels after the Federal
District Court.
MAKING COMPLAINTS

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 7 How to make a complaint about quality of care, waiting

*Section 7.2 How to make a complaint
Legal Terms
A “Complaint” is also called a “grievance.”
“Making a complaint” is also called “filing a grievance.”
“Using the process for complaints” is also called “using the process for
filing a grievance."
A “fast complaint” is also called an “expedited grievance.”

*Section 7.3 Step-by-step: Making a complaint
Step 1: Contact us promptly – either by phone or in writing.
Usually, calling Customer Service is the first step. If there is anything else
you need to do, Customer Service will let you know.
If you do not wish to call (or you called and were not satisfied), you can
put your complaint in writing and send it to us. If you put your complaint
in writing, we will respond to your complaint in writing.
Grievances received verbally will be responded to in writing, unless you
request a verbal response.
Although we may verbally contact you to discuss your grievance and/or the
resolution, grievances received in writing will be responded to in writing.
Grievances related to quality of care, regardless of how the grievance is filed,
will be responded to in writing, including a description of your right to file a
written complaint with the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO).
All grievances (verbal and written), will be responded to within the following
timeframes:
Standard Grievances (any complaint other than an expedited grievance
defined above) will be responded to as expeditiously as your case
requires, based on your health status, but no later than 30 days after
receipt of your grievance. Blue Cross MedicareRx Plus (PDP) may extend
the 30-day timeframe by up to 14 days if either you request the extension
or if Blue Cross MedicareRx Plus (PDP) determines additional information
is needed and that the delay is in your best interest. If there is a delay,
Blue Cross MedicareRx Plus (PDP) will notify you in writing of the reason
for the delay.
Expedited Grievances may only be filed if Blue Cross MedicareRx Plus
(PDP) denies your request for an expedited coverage determination or
expedited redetermination. Expedited Grievances will be responded to
within 24 hours.
The deadline for making a complaint is 60 calendar days from the time you
had the problem you want to complain about.
Step 2: We look into your complaint and give you our answer.
If possible, we will answer you right away. If you call us with a complaint,
we may be able to give you an answer on the same phone call.
Most complaints are answered within 30 calendar days. If we need more
information and the delay is in your best interest or if you ask for more time,
we can take up to 14 more calendar days (44 calendar days total) to answer
your complaint. If we decide to take extra days, we will tell you in writing.
If you are making a complaint because we denied your request for a
“fast coverage decision” or a “fast appeal,” we will automatically give
you a “fast complaint.” If you have a “fast complaint,” it means we will give
you an answer within 24 hours.
If we do not agree with some or all of your complaint or don’t take
responsibility for the problem you are complaining about, we will include our
reasons in our response to you.

*Section 7.4 You can also make complaints about quality of care to the
Quality Improvement Organization
When your complaint is about quality of care, you also have two extra options:
You can make your complaint directly to the Quality Improvement
Organization. The Quality Improvement Organization is a group of practicing
doctors and other health care experts paid by the Federal government to
check and improve the care given to Medicare patients. Chapter 2 has contact
information.
Or
You can make your complaint to both the Quality Improvement
Organization and us at the same time.

*Section 7.5 You can also tell Medicare about your complaint
You can submit a complaint about Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) directly to
Medicare. To submit a complaint to Medicare, go to www.medicare.gov/
MedicareComplaintForm/home.aspx. You may also call 1-800-MEDICARE
(1-800-633-4227). TTY/TDD users can call 1-877-486-2048.
