CHAPTER 9:
Legal notices

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 Notice about governing law
The principal law that applies to this Evidence of Coverage document is Title XVIII of the
Social Security Act and the regulations created under the Social Security Act by the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. In addition, other Federal laws
may apply and, under certain circumstances, the laws of the state you live in. This
may affect your rights and responsibilities even if the laws are not included or explained
in this document.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 Notice about non-discrimination
We don’t discriminate based on race, ethnicity, national origin, color, religion, sex,
sexual orientation, gender, age, mental or physical disability, health status, claims
experience, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability, or geographic
location within the service area. All organizations that provide Medicare prescription
drug plans, like our plan, must obey Federal laws against discrimination, including
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age
Discrimination Act of 1975, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 1557 of the
Affordable Care Act, all other laws that apply to organizations that get Federal funding,
and any other laws and rules that apply for any other reason.
If you want more information or have concerns about discrimination or unfair
treatment, please call the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil
Rights at 1-800-368-1019 (TTY 1-800-537-7697) or your local Office for Civil Rights.
If you have a disability and need help with access to care, please call us at Customer
Service. If you have a complaint, such as a problem with wheelchair access, Customer
Service can help.

SECTION 3 Notice about Medicare Secondary Payer subrogation
rights
We have the right and responsibility to collect for covered Medicare prescription drugs
for which Medicare is not the primary payer. According to CMS regulations at 42 CFR
sections 422.108 and 423.462, Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP), as a Medicare
prescription drug plan sponsor, will exercise the same rights of recovery that the
Secretary exercises under CMS regulations in subparts B through D of part 411 of 42
CFR and the rules established in this section supersede any State laws.
