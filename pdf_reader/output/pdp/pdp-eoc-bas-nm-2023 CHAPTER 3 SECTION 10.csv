SECTION 10 Programs on drug safety and managing medications

*Section 10.1 Programs to help members use drugs safely
We conduct drug use reviews for our members to help make sure that they are getting
safe and appropriate care.
We do a review each time you fill a prescription. We also review our records on a
regular basis. During these reviews, we look for potential problems such as:
Possible medication errors
Drugs that may not be necessary because you are taking another drug to
treat the same condition
Drugs that may not be safe or appropriate because of your age or gender
Certain combinations of drugs that could harm you if taken at the same time
Prescriptions for drugs that have ingredients you are allergic to
Possible errors in the amount (dosage) of a drug you are taking
Unsafe amounts of opioid pain medications
If we see a possible problem in your use of medications, we will work with your provider
to correct the problem.

*Section 10.2 Drug Management Program (DMP) to help members safely use
their opioid medications
We have a program that helps make sure members safely use prescription opioids
and other frequently abused medications. This program is called a Drug Management
Program (DMP). If you use opioid medications that you get from several doctors or
pharmacies, or if you had a recent opioid overdose, we may talk to your doctors to
make sure your use of opioid medications is appropriate and medically necessary.
Working with your doctors, if we decide your use of prescription opioid medications
is not safe, we may limit how you can get those medications. If we place you in our
DMP, the limitations may be:
Requiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid medications from a
certain pharmacy(ies)
Requiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid medications from a
certain doctor(s)
Limiting the amount of opioid medications we will cover for you
If we plan on limiting how you may get these medications or how much you can get,
we will send you a letter in advance. The letter will explain the limitations we think
should apply to you. You will have an opportunity to tell us which doctors or
pharmacies you prefer to use, and about any other information you think is important
for us to know. After you’ve had the opportunity to respond, if we decide to limit your
coverage for these medications, we will send you another letter confirming the
limitation. If you think we made a mistake or you disagree with our determination or
with the limitation, you and your prescriber have the right to appeal. If you appeal,
we will review your case and give you a decision. If we continue to deny any part of
your request related to the limitations that apply to your access to medications, we
will automatically send your case to an independent reviewer outside of our plan. See
Chapter 7 for information about how to ask for an appeal.
You will not be placed in our DMP if you have certain medical conditions, such as
active cancer-related pain or sickle cell disease, you are receiving hospice, palliative,
or end-of-life care, or live in a long-term care facility.

*Section 10.3 Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program to help
members manage their medications
We have a program that can help our members with complex health needs. Our
progam is called a Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program. This program
is voluntary and free. A team of pharmacists and doctors developed the program for
us to help make sure that our members get the most benefit from the drugs they
take.
Some members who take medications for different medical conditions and have high
drug costs, or are in a DMP to help members use their opioids safely, may be able to
get services through an MTM program. A pharmacist or other health professional will
give you a comprehensive review of all your medications. During the review, you can
talk about your medications, your costs, and any problems or questions you have
about your prescription and over-the-counter medications. You’ll get a written summary
which has a recommended to-do list that includes steps you should take to get the
best results from your medications. You’ll also get a medication list that will include
all the medications you’re taking, how much you take, and when and why you take
them. In addition, members in the MTM program will receive information on the safe
disposal of prescription medications that are controlled substances.
It’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about your recommended to-do list and
medication list. Bring the summary with you to your visit or anytime you talk with your
doctors, pharmacists, and other health care providers. Also, keep your medication
list up to date and with you (for example, with your ID) in case you go to the hospital
or emergency room. Also, keep your medication list up to date and keep it with you
(for example, with your ID) in case you go to the hospital or emergency room.
If we have a program that fits your needs, we will automatically enroll you in the
program and send you information. If you decide not to participate, please notify us
and we will withdraw you. If you have any questions about this program, please contact
Customer Service.
