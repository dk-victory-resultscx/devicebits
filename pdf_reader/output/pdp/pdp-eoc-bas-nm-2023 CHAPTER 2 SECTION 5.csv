SECTION 5 Social Security
Social Security is responsible for determining eligibility and handling enrollment for
Medicare. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who are 65 or older, or who
have a disability or End-Stage Renal Disease and meet certain conditions, are eligible
for Medicare. If you are already getting Social Security checks, enrollment into Medicare
is automatic. If you are not getting Social Security checks, you have to enroll in
Medicare. To apply for Medicare, you can call Social Security or visit your local Social
Security office.
Social Security is also responsible for determining who has to pay an extra amount
for their Part D drug coverage because they have a higher income. If you got a letter
from Social Security telling you that you have to pay the extra amount and have
questions about the amount or if your income went down because of a life-changing
event, you can call Social Security to ask for reconsideration.
If you move or change your mailing address, it is important that you contact Social
Security to let them know.
