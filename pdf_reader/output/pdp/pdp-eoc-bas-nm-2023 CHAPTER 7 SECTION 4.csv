SECTION 4 A guide to the basics of coverage decisions and appeals

*Section 4.1 Asking for coverage decisions and making appeals: the big picture
Coverage decisions and appeals deal with problems related to your benefits and
coverage for prescription drugs, including payments. This is the process you use for
issues such as whether a drug is covered or not and the way in which the drug is
covered.
Asking for coverage decisions prior to receiving services
A coverage decision is a decision we make about your coverage or about the amount
we will pay for your prescription drugs.
We are making a coverage decision for you whenever we decide what is covered for
you and how much we pay. In some cases, we might decide a drug is not covered or
is no longer covered by Medicare for you. If you disagree with this coverage decision,
you can make an appeal.
Making an appeal
If we make a coverage decision, whether before or after a service is received, and you
are not satisfied, you can “appeal” the decision. An appeal is a formal way of asking
us to review and change a coverage decision we have made. Under certain
circumstances, which we discuss later, you can request an expedited or “fast appeal”
of a coverage decision. Your appeal is handled by different reviewers than those who
made the original decision.
When you appeal a decision for the first time, this is called a Level 1 appeal. In this
appeal, we review the coverage decision we made to check to see if we were properly
following the rules. When we have completed the review, we give you our decision.
In limited circumstances a request for Level 1 appeal will be dismissed, which means
we won’t review the request. Examples of when a request will be dismissed include
if the request is incomplete, if someone makes the request on your behalf but isn’t
legally authorized to do so or if you ask for your request to be withdrawn. If we dismiss
a request for a Level 1 appeal, we will send a notice explaining why the request was
dismissed and how to ask for a review of the dismissal.
If we do not dismiss your case but say no to all or part of your Level 1 appeal, you can
go on to a Level 2 appeal. The Level 2 appeal is conducted by an independent review
organization that is not connected to us. Appeals for medical services and Part B drugs
will be automatically sent to the independent review organization for a Level 2 appeal
- you do not need to do anything. For Part D drug appeals, if we say no to all or part
of your appeal you will need to ask for a Level 2 appeal. Part D appeals are discussed
further in Section 6 of this chapter. If you are not satisfied with the decision at the
Level 2 appeal, you may be able to continue through additional levels of appeal (Section
9 in this chapter explains the Level 3, 4, and 5 appeals processes).

*Section 4.2 How to get help when you are asking for a coverage decision or
making an appeal
Here are resources if you decide to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a
decision:
You can call us at Customer Service.
You can get free help from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program.
Your doctor or other prescriber can make a request for you. For Part D
prescription drugs, your doctor or other prescriber can request a coverage
decision or a Level 1 appeal on your behalf. If your Level 1 appeal is denied
your doctor or prescriber can request a Level 2 appeal.
You can ask someone to act on your behalf. If you want to, you can name
another person to act for you as your “representative” to ask for a coverage
decision or make an appeal.
If you want a friend, relative, or other person to be your representative,
call Customer Service and ask for the “Appointment of Representative”
form. (The form is also available on Medicare’s website at www.cms.gov/
Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf or on our
website at getbluenm.com/pdp.) The form gives that person permission
to act on your behalf. It must be signed by you and by the person who
you would like to act on your behalf. You must give us a copy of the
signed form.
While we can accept an appeal request without the form, we cannot
begin or complete our review until we receive it. If we do not receive the
form within 44 calendar days after receiving your appeal request (our
deadline for making a decision on your appeal), your appeal request will
be dismissed. If this happens, we will send you a written notice explaining
your right to ask the independent review organization to review our
decision to dismiss your appeal.
You also have the right to hire a lawyer. You may contact your own lawyer,
or get the name of a lawyer from your local bar association or other referral
service. There are also groups that will give you free legal services if you
qualify. However, you are not required to hire a lawyer to ask for any kind
of coverage decision or appeal a decision.
