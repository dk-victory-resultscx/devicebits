CHAPTER 10:
Definitions of important words
Appeal – An appeal is something you do if you disagree with our decision to deny a
request for coverage of prescription drugs or payment for drugs you already received.
Annual Enrollment Period – The time period of October 15 until December 7 of each
year when members can change their health or drug plans or switch to Original
Medicare.
Brand Name Drug – A prescription drug that is manufactured and sold by the
pharmaceutical company that originally researched and developed the drug. Brand
name drugs have the same active-ingredient formula as the generic version of the
drug. However, generic drugs are manufactured and sold by other drug manufacturers
and are generally not available until after the patent on the brand name drug has
expired.
Catastrophic Coverage Stage – The stage in the Part D Drug Benefit where you pay
a low copayment or coinsurance for your drugs after you or other qualified parties
on your behalf have spent $7,400 in covered drugs during the covered year.
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) – The Federal agency that
administers Medicare.
Coinsurance – An amount you may be required to pay, expressed as a percentage
(for example 20%) as your share of the cost for prescription drugs after you pay any
deductibles.
Complaint – The formal name for “making a complaint” is “filing a grievance.” The
complaint process is used only for certain types of problems. This includes problems
related to quality of care, waiting times, and the customer service you receive. It also
includes complaints if your plan does not follow the time periods in the appeal process.
Copayment (or “copay”) – An amount you may be required to pay as your share of
the cost for a prescription drug. A copayment is a set amount (for example $10), rather
than a percentage.
Cost Sharing – Cost sharing refers to amounts that a member has to pay when drugs
are received. (This is in addition to the plan’s monthly premium.) Cost sharing includes
any combination of the following three types of payments: (1) any deductible amount
a plan may impose before drugs are covered; (2) any fixed “copayment” amount that
a plan requires when a specific drug is received; or (3) any “coinsurance” amount, a
percentage of the total amount paid for a drug, that a plan requires when a specific
drug is received.
Cost-Sharing Tier – Every drug on the list of covered drugs is in one of 5 cost-sharing
tiers. In general, the higher the cost-sharing tier, the higher your cost for the drug.
Coverage Determination – A decision about whether a drug prescribed for you is
covered by the plan and the amount, if any, you are required to pay for the prescription.
In general, if you bring your prescription to a pharmacy and the pharmacy tells you
the prescription isn’t covered under your plan, that isn’t a coverage determination.
You need to call or write to your plan to ask for a formal decision about the coverage.
Coverage determinations are called “coverage decisions” in this document.
Covered Drugs – The term we use to mean all of the prescription drugs covered by
our plan.
Creditable Prescription Drug Coverage – Prescription drug coverage (for example,
from an employer or union) that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as
Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage. People who have this kind of coverage
when they become eligible for Medicare can generally keep that coverage without
paying a penalty, if they decide to enroll in Medicare prescription drug coverage later.
Customer Service – A department within our plan responsible for answering your
questions about your membership, benefits, grievances, and appeals. See Chapter 2
for information about how to contact Customer Service.
Daily cost-sharing rate – A “daily cost-sharing rate” may apply when your doctor
prescribes less than a full month’s supply of certain drugs for you and you are required
to pay a copayment. A daily cost-sharing rate is the copayment divided by the number
of days in a month’s supply. Here is an example: If your copayment for a one-month
supply of a drug is $30, and a one-month’s supply in your plan is 30 days, then your
“daily cost-sharing rate” is $1 per day.
Deductible – The amount you must pay for prescriptions before our plan pays.
Disenroll or Disenrollment – The process of ending your membership in our plan.
Dispensing Fee – A fee charged each time a covered drug is dispensed to pay for the
cost of filling a prescription, such as the pharmacist’s time to prepare and package
the prescription.
Emergency – A medical emergency is when you, or any other prudent layperson with
an average knowledge of health and medicine, believe that you have medical symptoms
that require immediate medical attention to prevent loss of life (and, if you are a
pregnant woman, loss of an unborn child), loss of a limb, or loss of function of a limb,
or loss of or serious impairment to a bodily function. The medical symptoms may be
an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse.
Evidence of Coverage (EOC) and Disclosure Information – This document, along
with your enrollment form and any other attachments, riders, or other optional
coverage selected, which explains your coverage, what we must do, your rights, and
what you have to do as a member of our plan.
Exception – A type of coverage decision that, if approved, allows you to get a drug
that is not on our formulary (a formulary exception), or get a non-preferred drug at
a lower cost-sharing level (a tiering exception). You may also request an exception if
our plan requires you to try another drug before receiving the drug you are requesting,
or if our plan limits the quantity or dosage of the drug you are requesting (a formulary
exception).
Extra Help – A Medicare or a State program to help people with limited income and
resources pay Medicare prescription drug program costs, such as premiums,
deductibles, and coinsurance.
Generic Drug – A prescription drug that is approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) as having the same active ingredient(s) as the brand name drug.
Generally, a “generic” drug works the same as a brand name drug and usually costs
less.
Grievance – A type of complaint you make about our plan, providers, or pharmacies,
including a complaint concerning the quality of your care. This does not involve
coverage or payment disputes.
Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA) – If your modified adjusted
gross income as reported on your IRS tax return from 2 years ago is above a certain
amount, you’ll pay the standard premium amount and an Income Related Monthly
Adjustment Amount, also known as IRMAA. IRMAA is an extra charge added to your
premium. Less than 5% of people with Medicare are affected, so most people will not
pay a higher premium.
Initial Coverage Limit – The maximum limit of coverage under the Initial Coverage
Stage.
Initial Coverage Stage – This is the stage before your total drug costs including
amounts you have paid and what your plan has paid on your behalf for the year have
reached $4,660.
Initial Enrollment Period – When you are first eligible for Medicare, the period of
time when you can sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B. If you’re eligible for Medicare
when you turn 65, your Initial Enrollment Period is the 7-month period that begins 3
months before the month you turn 65, includes the month you turn 65, and ends 3
months after the month you turn 65.
List of Covered Drugs (Formulary or “Drug List”) – A list of prescription drugs
covered by the plan.
Low Income Subsidy (LIS) – See “Extra Help.”
Medicaid (or Medical Assistance) – A joint Federal and State program that helps
with medical costs for some people with low incomes and limited resources. State
Medicaid programs vary, but most health care costs are covered if you qualify for
both Medicare and Medicaid.

and Drug Administration or supported by certain reference books.

Disease (generally those with permanent kidney failure who need dialysis or a kidney
transplant).

by a private company that contracts with Medicare to provide you with all your
Medicare Part A and Part B benefits. A Medicare Advantage Plan can be an i) HMO, ii)
PPO, a iii) Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plan, or a iv) Medicare Medical Savings Account
(MSA) plan. Besides choosing from these types of plans, a Medicare Advantage HMO
or PPO plan can also be a Special Needs Plan (SNP) In most cases, Medicare Advantage
Plans also offer Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage). These plans are called
Medicare Advantage Plans with Prescription Drug Coverage.
Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program – A program that provides discounts on
most covered Part D brand name drugs to Part D members who have reached the
Coverage Gap Stage and who are not already receiving “Extra Help.” Discounts are
based on agreements between the Federal government and certain drug
manufacturers.

dental or hearing, that a Medicare Advantage plan may offer.

contracts with Medicare to provide Part A and Part B benefits to people with Medicare

for outpatient prescription drugs, vaccines, biologicals, and some supplies not covered
by Medicare Part A or Part B.
“Medigap” (Medicare Supplement Insurance) Policy – Medicare supplement
insurance sold by private insurance companies to fill “gaps” in Original Medicare.
Medigap policies only work with Original Medicare. (A Medicare Advantage Plan is not
a Medigap policy.)

is eligible to get covered services, who has enrolled in our plan and whose enrollment
has been confirmed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).
Network Pharmacy – A pharmacy that contracts with our plan where members of
our plan can get their prescription drug benefits. In most cases, your prescriptions
are covered only if they are filled at one of our network pharmacies.
Original Medicare (“Traditional Medicare” or “Fee-for-service” Medicare) – Original
Medicare is offered by the government, and not a private health plan like Medicare
Advantage Plans and prescription drug plans. Under Original Medicare, Medicare
services are covered by paying doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers
payment amounts established by Congress. You can see any doctor, hospital, or other
health care provider that accepts Medicare. You must pay the deductible. Medicare
pays its share of the Medicare-approved amount, and you pay your share. Original
Medicare has two parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance)
and is available everywhere in the United States.
Out-of-Network Pharmacy – A pharmacy that does not have a contract with our
plan to coordinate or provide covered drugs to members of our plan. Most drugs you
get from out-of-network pharmacies are not covered by our plan unless certain
conditions apply.
Out-of-Pocket Costs – See the definition for “cost sharing” above. A member’s
cost-sharing requirement to pay for a portion of drugs received is also referred to as
the member’s “out-of-pocket” cost requirement.
PACE plan – A PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) plan combines
medical, social, and long-term care (LTC) services for frail people to help people stay
independent and living in their community (instead of moving to a nursing home) as
long as possible. People enrolled in PACE plans receive both their Medicare and
Medicaid benefits through the plan. PACE is not available in all states. If you would
like to know if PACE is available in your state, please contact Customer Service.
Part C – see “Medicare Advantage (MA) Plan.”
Part D – The voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program.
Part D Drugs – Drugs that can be covered under Part D. We may or may not offer all
Part D drugs. Certain categories of drugs have been excluded as covered Part D drugs
by Congress.
Part D Late Enrollment Penalty – An amount added to your monthly premium for
Medicare drug coverage if you go without creditable coverage (coverage that is
expected to pay, on average, at least as much as standard Medicare prescription drug
coverage) for a continuous period of 63 days or more after you are first eligible to join
a Part D plan.

covered Part D drugs at certain network pharmacies.

health care experts paid by the Federal government to check and improve the care

drugs for quality, safety, or utilization reasons. Limits may be on the amount of the

drug plan. The plan may disenroll you if you permanently move out of the plan’s
service area.
Special Enrollment Period – A set time when members can change their health or
drug plans or return to Original Medicare. Situations in which you may be eligible for
a Special Enrollment Period include: if you move outside the service area, if you are
getting “Extra Help” with your prescription drug costs, if you move into a nursing home,
or if we violate our contract with you.
Standard Cost Sharing – Standard cost sharing is cost sharing other than preferred
cost sharing offered at a network pharmacy.
Step Therapy – A utilization tool that requires you to first try another drug to treat
your medical condition before we will cover the drug your physician may have initially
prescribed.
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) – A monthly benefit paid by Social Security to

older. SSI benefits are not the same as Social Security benefits.
