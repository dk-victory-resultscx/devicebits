SECTION 7 Information about programs to help people pay for their
prescription drugs
The Medicare.gov website (https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d/costs-
for-medicare-drug-coverage/costs-in-the-coverage-gap/6-ways-to-get-help-with-
prescription-costs) provides information on how to lower your prescription drug costs.
For people with limited incomes, there are also other programs to assist, described
below.
Medicare’s “Extra Help” Program
Medicare provides “Extra Help” to pay prescription drug costs for people who have
limited income and resources. Resources include your savings and stocks, but not
your home or car. If you qualify, you get help paying for any Medicare drug plan’s
monthly premium, yearly deductible, and prescription copayments. This “Extra Help”
also counts toward your out-of-pocket costs.
If you automatically qualify for “Extra Help” Medicare will mail you a letter. You will
not have to apply. If you do not automatically qualify you may be able to get “Extra
Help” to pay for your prescription drug premiums and costs. To see if you qualify for
getting “Extra Help,” call:
1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048, 24
hours a day, 7 days a week;
The Social Security Office at 1-800-772-1213, between 8 am to 7 pm, Monday
through Friday. TTY users should call 1-800-325-0778 (applications); or
Your State Medicaid Office (applications). (See Section 6 of this chapter for
contact information.)
If you believe you have qualified for “Extra Help” and you believe that you are paying
an incorrect cost-sharing amount when you get your prescription at a pharmacy, our
plan has a process for you to either request assistance in obtaining evidence of your
proper copayment level, or, if you already have the evidence, to provide this evidence
to us.
Beneficiaries may contact our Customer Service Area to request assistance
in obtaining Best Available Evidence (BAE) information and for providing this
evidence.
When you contact us, we will verify if there is a discrepancy and/or if we are
able to resolve the discrepancy regarding your extra help based on the
information to which we have access. In some cases, we may need to request
you to provide documentation if you have it available. If you do not have
documentation available, we will attempt to verify the status of your extra
help through communication channels and in accordance with the guidance
established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
The documents listed below are valid for the purpose of establishing the
correct level of extra help and effective date for individuals who should be
deemed eligible for Low Income Subsidy (LIS). Each item listed below must
show that the person was eligible for Medicaid during a month after June of
the previous calendar year.
A copy of the beneficiary's Medicaid card that includes the beneficiary's
name and an eligibility date
If the copy of the beneficiary's Medicaid card does not indicate an
effective date, it will not be accepted as a form of BAE.
A copy of a State document that confirms active Medicaid status
A print-out from the State electronic enrollment file showing Medicaid
status
A screen print from the State's Medicaid systems showing Medicaid status
Other documentation provided by the State showing Medicaid status
A letter from SSA showing that the individual receives SSI; or
An application Filed by Deemed Eligible confirming that the beneficiary
is "...automatically eligible for Extra Help..."
Part D sponsors are required to accept any one of the following forms of
evidence from the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s pharmacist, advocate,
representative, family member or other individual acting on behalf of the
beneficiary to establish that a beneficiary is institutionalized or, beginning
on a date specified by the Secretary, but no earlier than January 1, 2012, is
an individual receiving home and community-based services (HCBS) and
qualifies for zero cost-sharing:
1. A remittance from the facility showing Medicaid payment for a full
calendar month for that individual during a month after June of the
previous calendar year;
2. A copy of a state document that confirms Medicaid payment on
behalf of the individual to the facility for a full calendar month after
June of the previous calendar year;
3. A screen print from the State’s Medicaid systems showing that
individual’s institutional status based on at least a full calendar month
stay for Medicaid payment purposes during a month after June of
the previous calendar year.
4. Effective as of a date specified by the Secretary, but no earlier than
January 1, 2012, a copy of:
a) A State-issued Notice of Action, Notice of Determination, or
Notice of Enrollment that includes the beneficiary’s name and
HCBS eligibility date during a month after June of the previous
calendar year;
b) A State-approved HCBS Service Plan that includes the
beneficiary’s name and effective date beginning during a month
after June of the previous calendar year;
c) A State-issued prior authorization approval letter for HCBS that
includes the beneficiary’s name and effective date beginning
during a month after June of the previous calendar year;
d) Other documentation provided by the State showing HCBS
eligibility status during a month after June of the previous
calendar year; or,
e) A state-issued document, such as a remittance advice, confirming
payment for HCBS, including the beneficiary’s name and the
dates of HCBS
When we receive the evidence showing your copayment level, we will update
our system so that you can pay the correct copayment when you get your
next prescription at the pharmacy. If you overpay your copayment, we will
reimburse you. Either we will forward a check to you in the amount of your
overpayment or we will offset future copayments. If the pharmacy hasn’t
collected a copayment from you and is carrying your copayment as a debt
owed by you, we may make the payment directly to the pharmacy. If a state
paid on your behalf, we may make payment directly to the state. Please
contact Customer Service if you have questions.
What if you have coverage from a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program
(SPAP)?
Many states and the U.S. Virgin Islands offer help paying for prescriptions, drug plan
premiums and/or other drug costs. If you are enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical
Assistance Program (SPAP), or any other program that provides coverage for Part D
drugs (other than “Extra Help”), you still get the 70% discount on covered brand name
drugs. Also, the plan pays 5% of the costs of brand drugs in the coverage gap. The
70% discount and the 5% paid by the plan are both applied to the price of the drug
before any SPAP or other coverage.
What if you have coverage from an AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP)?
What is the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP)?
The AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) helps ADAP-eligible individuals living with
HIV/AIDS have access to life-saving HIV medications. Medicare Part D prescription
drugs that are also on the ADAP formulary qualify for prescription cost-sharing
assistance. The New Mexico Department of Health. Note: To be eligible for the ADAP
operating in your State, individuals must meet certain criteria, including proof of State
residence and HIV status, low income as defined by the State, and uninsured/
under-insured status.
