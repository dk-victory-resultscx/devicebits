SECTION 7 What types of drugs are not covered by the plan?

*Section 7.1 Types of drugs we do not cover
This section tells you what kinds of prescription drugs are "excluded." This means
Medicare does not pay for these drugs.
If you get drugs that are excluded, you must pay for them yourself. If you appeal and
the requested drug is found not to be excluded under Part D, we will pay for or cover
it. (For information about appealing a decision, go to Chapter 7, Section 5.5.)
Here are three general rules about drugs that Medicare drug plans will not cover
under Part D:
Our plan’s Part D drug coverage cannot cover a drug that would be covered
under Medicare Part A or Part B.
Our plan cannot cover a drug purchased outside the United States or its
territories.
Our plan usually cannot cover off-label use. "Off-label use" is any use of the
drug other than those indicated on a drug’s label as approved by the Food
and Drug Administration.
Coverage for "off-label use" is allowed only when the use is supported by
certain references, such as the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug
Information and the DRUGDEX Information System.
In addition, by law, the following categories of drugs are not covered by Medicare
drug plans:
Non-prescription drugs (also called over-the-counter drugs)
Drugs used to promote fertility
Drugs used for the relief of cough or cold symptoms
Drugs used for cosmetic purposes or to promote hair growth
Prescription vitamins and mineral products, except prenatal vitamins and
fluoride preparations
Drugs used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction
Drugs used for treatment of anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain
Outpatient drugs for which the manufacturer seeks to require that associated
tests or monitoring services be purchased exclusively from the manufacturer
as a condition of sale
In addition, if you are receiving “Extra Help” to pay for your prescriptions, the “Extra
Help” program will not pay for the drugs not normally covered. However, if you have
drug coverage through Medicaid, your state Medicaid program may cover some
prescription drugs not normally covered in a Medicare drug plan. Please contact your
state Medicaid program to determine what drug coverage may be available to you.
(You can find phone numbers and contact information for Medicaid in Chapter 2,
Section 6.)
