SECTION 5 What if one of your drugs is not covered in the way you’d
like it to be covered?

*Section 5.1 There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the
way you’d like it to be covered
There are situations where there is a prescription drug you are taking, or one that
you and your provider think you should be taking that is not on our formulary or is
on our formulary with restrictions. For example:
The drug might not be covered at all. Or maybe a generic version of the drug
is covered but the brand name version you want to take is not covered.
The drug is covered, but there are extra rules or restrictions on coverage for
that drug, as explained in Section 4.
The drug is covered, but it is in a cost-sharing tier that makes your cost sharing
more expensive than you think it should be.
There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way that you’d
like it to be covered. If your drug is not on the Drug List or if your drug is
restricted, go to Section 5.2 to learn what you can do.

*Section 5.2 What can you do if your drug is not on the Drug List or if the drug
is restricted in some way?
If your drug is not on the Drug List or is restricted, here are options:
You may be able to get a temporary supply of the drug.
You can change to another drug.
You can request an exception and ask the plan to cover the drug or remove
restrictions from the drug.
You may be able to get a temporary supply
Under certain circumstances, the plan must provide a temporary supply of a drug
that you are already taking. This temporary supply gives you time to talk with your
provider about the change in coverage and decide what to do.
To be eligible for a temporary supply, the drug you have been taking must no longer
be on the plan’s Drug List OR is now restricted in some way.
If you are a new member, we will cover a temporary supply of your drug
during the first 90 days of your membership in the plan.
If you were in the plan last year, we will cover a temporary supply of your
drug during the first 90 days of the calendar year.
This temporary supply will be for a maximum of a 30-day supply. If your
prescription is written for fewer days, we will allow multiple fills to provide
up to a maximum of a 30-day supply of medication. The prescription must
be filled at a network pharmacy. (Please note that the long-term care
pharmacy may provide the drug in smaller amounts at a time to prevent
waste.)
For those members who have been in the plan for more than 90 days
and reside in a long-term care facility and need a supply right away:
We will cover one 31-day emergency supply of a particular drug, or less if your
prescription is written for fewer days. This is in addition to the above temporary
supply.
For questions about a temporary supply, call Customer Service.
During the time when you are using a temporary supply of a drug, you should talk
with your provider to decide what to do when your temporary supply runs out. You
have two options.
1) You can change to another drug
Talk with your provider about whether there is a different drug covered by the plan
that may work just as well for you. You can call Customer Service to ask for a list of
covered drugs that treat the same medical condition. This list can help your provider
find a covered drug that might work for you.
2) You can ask for an exception
You and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception and cover the drug in
the way you would like it covered. If your provider says that you have medical reasons
that justify asking us for an exception, your provider can help you request an exception.
For example, you can ask the plan to cover a drug even though it is not on the plan’s
Drug List. Or you can ask the plan to make an exception and cover the drug without
restrictions.
If you are a current member and a drug you are taking will be removed from the
formulary or restricted in some way for next year, we will tell you about any change
prior to the new year. You can ask for an exception before next year, and we will give
you an answer within 72 hours after we receive your request (or your prescriber’s
supporting statement). If we approve your request, we will authorize the coverage
before the change takes effect.
If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 7, Section 5.4 tells you
what to do. It explains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare
to make sure your request is handled promptly and fairly.

*Section 5.3 What can you do if your drug is in a cost-sharing tier you think
is too high?
If your drug is in a cost-sharing tier you think is too high, here are things you can do:
You can change to another drug
If your drug is in a cost-sharing tier you think is too high, talk to your provider. There
may be a different drug in a lower cost-sharing tier that might work just as well for
you. You can call Customer Service to ask for a list of covered drugs that treat the
same medical condition. This list can help your provider find a covered drug that might
work for you.
You can ask for an exception
You and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception in the cost-sharing tier
for the drug so that you pay less for it. If your provider says that you have medical
reasons that justify asking us for an exception, your provider can help you request
an exception to the rule.
If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 7, Section 5.4 tells what
to do. It explains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare to
make sure your request is handled promptly and fairly.
Drugs in our Specialty Tier 5 are not eligible for this type of exception. We do not lower
the cost-sharing amount for drugs in this tier.
