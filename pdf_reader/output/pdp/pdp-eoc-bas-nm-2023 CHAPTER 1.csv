CHAPTER 1:
Getting started as a member

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 Introduction

*Section 1.1 You are enrolled in Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP), which is
a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan
You are covered by Original Medicare or another health plan for your health care
coverage, and you have chosen to get your Medicare prescription drug coverage
through our plan, Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP). We are required to cover all
Part A and Part B services. However, cost sharing and provider access in this plan
differ from Original Medicare.
Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) is a Medicare prescription drug plan (PDP). Like
all Medicare plans, this Medicare prescription drug plan is approved by Medicare and
run by a private company.

*Section 1.2 What is the Evidence of Coverage document about?
This Evidence of Coverage document tells you how to get your prescription drugs. It
explains your rights and responsibilities, what is covered, what you pay as a member
of the plan, and how to file a complaint if you are not satisfied with a decision or
treatment.
The word “coverage” and “covered drugs” refers to the prescription drug coverage
available to you as a member of Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP).
It’s important for you to learn what the plan’s rules are and what coverage is available
to you. We encourage you to set aside some time to look through this Evidence of
Coverage document.
If you are confused, concerned or just have a question, please contact Customer
Service.

*Section 1.3 Legal information about the Evidence of Coverage
This Evidence of Coverage is part of our contract with you about how Blue Cross
MedicareRx Basic (PDP) covers your care. Other parts of this contract include your
enrollment form, the List of Covered Drugs (Formulary), and any notices you receive
from us about changes to your coverage or conditions that affect your coverage. These
notices are sometimes called “riders” or “amendments.”
The contract is in effect for months in which you are enrolled in Blue Cross MedicareRx
Basic (PDP) between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023.
Each calendar year, Medicare allows us to make changes to the plans that we offer.
This means we can change the costs and benefits of Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic
(PDP) after December 31, 2023. We can also choose to stop offering the plan, in your
service area, after December 31, 2023.
Medicare (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) must approve Blue Cross
MedicareRx Basic (PDP) each year. You can continue each year to get Medicare
coverage as a member of our plan as long as we choose to continue to offer the plan
and Medicare renews its approval of the plan.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 What makes you eligible to be a plan member?

*Section 2.1 Your eligibility requirements
You are eligible for membership in our plan as long as:
You have Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B (or you have both Part A and
Part B)
-- and -- you are a United States citizen or are lawfully present in the United
States
-- and -- you live in our geographic service area (Section 2.2 below describes
our service area). Incarcerated individuals are not considered living in the
geographic service area even if they are physically located in it.

*Section 2.2 Here is the plan service area for Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic
(PDP)
Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) is available only to individuals who live in our plan
service area. To remain a member of our plan, you must continue to reside in the
plan service area. The service area is described below.
Our service area includes this state: New Mexico
We offer coverage in several states. However, there may be cost or other differences
between the plans we offer in each state. If you move out of state and into a state
that is still within our service area, you must call Customer Service in order to update
your information. If you move into a state outside of our service area, you cannot
remain a member of our plan. Please call Customer Service to find out if we have a
plan in your new state.
If you plan to move out of the service area, you cannot remain a member of this plan.
Please contact Customer Service to see if we have a plan in your new area. When you
move, you will have a Special Enrollment Period that will allow you to switch to Original
Medicare or enroll in a Medicare health or drug plan that is available in your new
location.
It is also important that you call Social Security if you move or change your mailing
address. You can find phone numbers and contact information for Social Security in
Chapter 2, Section 5.

*Section 2.3 U.S. Citizen or Lawful Presence
A member of a Medicare health plan must be a U.S. citizen or lawfully present in the
United States. Medicare (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) will notify
Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) if you are not eligible to remain a member on this
basis. Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) must disenroll you if you do not meet this
requirement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 Important membership materials you will receive

*Section 3.1 Your plan membership card
While you are a member of our plan, you must use your membership card for
prescription drugs you get at network pharmacies. You should also show the provider
your Medicaid card, if applicable. Here’s a sample membership card to show you what
yours will look like:
Please carry your card with you at all times and remember to show your card when
you get covered drugs. If your plan membership card is damaged, lost, or stolen, call
Customer Service right away and we will send you a new card.
You may need to use your red, white, and blue Medicare card to get covered medical
care and services under Original Medicare.

*Section 3.2 Pharmacy Directory
The pharmacy directory lists our network pharmacies. Network pharmacies are all
of the pharmacies that have agreed to fill covered prescriptions for our plan members.
You can use the Pharmacy Directory to find the network pharmacy you want to use.
See Chapter 3, Section 2.5 for information on when you can use pharmacies that are
not in the plan’s network.
The Pharmacy Directory will also tell you which of the pharmacies in our network have
preferred cost sharing, which may be lower than the standard cost sharing offered
by other network pharmacies for some drugs.
If you don’t have the Pharmacy Directory, you can get a copy from Customer Service.
You can also find this information on our website at getbluenm.com/pdp.

*Section 3.3 The plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary)
The plan has a List of Covered Drugs (Formulary). We call it the “Drug List” for short. It
tells which Part D prescription drugs are covered under the Part D benefit included
in Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP). The drugs on this list are selected by the plan
with the help of a team of doctors and pharmacists. The list must meet requirements
set by Medicare. Medicare has approved the Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) Drug
List.
The Drug List also tells you if there are any rules that restrict coverage for your drugs.
We will provide you a copy of the Drug List. To get the most complete and current
information about which drugs are covered, you can visit the plan’s website (getbluenm.
com/pdp) or call Customer Service.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 Your monthly costs for Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic
(PDP)
Your costs may include the following:
Plan Premium (Section 4.1)
Monthly Medicare Part B Premium (Section 4.2)
Part D Late Enrollment Penalty (Section 4.3)
Income Related Monthly Adjusted Amount (Section 4.4)
In some situations, your plan premium could be less
There are programs to help people with limited resources pay for their drugs. These
include “Extra Help” and State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs. Chapter 2,
Section 7 tells more about these programs. If you qualify, enrolling in the program
might lower your monthly plan premium.
If you are already enrolled and getting help from one of these programs, the
information about premiums in this Evidence of Coverage may not apply to you.
We have included a separate insert, called the “Evidence of Coverage Rider for People
Who Get Extra Help Paying for Prescription Drugs” (also known as the “Low Income
Subsidy Rider” or the “LIS Rider”), which tells you about your drug coverage. If you
don’t have this insert, please call Customer Service and ask for the “LIS Rider.”
Medicare Part B and Part D premiums differ for people with different incomes. If you
have questions about these premiums review your copy of Medicare & You 2023
handbook, the section called “2023 Medicare Costs.” If you need a copy you can
download it from the Medicare website (www.medicare.gov). Or, you can order a
printed copy by phone at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week. TTY users call 1-877-486-2048.

*Section 4.1 Plan Premium
As a member of our plan, you pay a monthly plan premium. For 2023, the monthly
premium for Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) is $76.70.

*Section 4.2 Monthly Medicare Part B Premium
Many members are required to pay other Medicare premiums
In addition to paying the monthly plan premium, you must continue paying your
Medicare premiums to remain a member of the plan. This includes your premium
for Part B. It may also include a premium for Part A which affects members who aren’t
eligible for premium free Part A.

*Section 4.3 Part D Late Enrollment Penalty
Some members are required to pay a Part D late enrollment penalty. The Part D
late enrollment penalty is an additional premium that must be paid for Part D coverage
if at any time after your initial enrollment period is over, there is a period of 63 days
or more in a row when you did not have Part D or other creditable prescription drug
coverage. “Creditable prescription drug coverage” is coverage that meets Medicare’s
minimum standards since it is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as
Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage. The cost of the late enrollment penalty
depends on how long you went without Part D or other creditable prescription drug
coverage. You will have to pay this penalty for as long as you have Part D coverage.
The Part D late enrollment penalty is added to your monthly premium. When you first
enroll in Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP), we let you know the amount of the
penalty. If you do not pay your Part D late enrollment penalty, you could lose your
prescription drug benefits.
You will not have to pay it if:
You receive “Extra Help” from Medicare to pay for your prescription drugs.
You have gone less than 63 days in a row without creditable coverage.
You have had creditable drug coverage through another source such as a
former employer, union, TRICARE, or Department of Veterans Affairs. Your
insurer or your human resources department will tell you each year if your
drug coverage is creditable coverage. This information may be sent to you
in a letter or included in a newsletter from the plan. Keep this information,
because you may need it if you join a Medicare drug plan later.
Note: Any notice must state that you had “creditable” prescription drug
coverage that is expected to pay as much as Medicare’s standard
prescription drug plan pays.
Note: The following are not creditable prescription drug coverage:
prescription drug discount cards, free clinics, and drug discount websites.
Medicare determines the amount of the penalty. Here is how it works:
If you went 63 days or more without Part D or other creditable prescription
drug coverage after you were first eligible to enroll in Part D, the plan will
count the number of full months that you did not have coverage. The penalty
is 1% for every month that you did not have creditable coverage. For example,
if you go 14 months without coverage, the penalty will be 14%.
Then Medicare determines the amount of the average monthly premium for
Medicare drug plans in the nation from the previous year. For 2023, this
average premium amount is $32.74.
To calculate your monthly penalty, you multiply the penalty percentage and
the average monthly premium and then round it to the nearest 10 cents. In
the example here it would be 14% times $32.74, which equals $4.5836. This
rounds to $4.58. This amount would be added to the monthly premium
for someone with a Part D late enrollment penalty.
There are three important things to note about this monthly Part D late enrollment
penalty:
First, the penalty may change each year, because the average monthly
premium can change each year.
Second, you will continue to pay a penalty every month for as long as you
are enrolled in a plan that has Medicare Part D drug benefits, even if you
change plans.
Third, if you are under 65 and currently receiving Medicare benefits, the
Part D late enrollment penalty will reset when you turn 65. After age 65, your
Part D late enrollment penalty will be based only on the months that you
don’t have coverage after your initial enrollment period for aging into
Medicare.
If you disagree about your Part D late enrollment penalty, you or your
representative can ask for a review. Generally, you must request this review within
60 days from the date on the first letter you receive stating you have to pay a late
enrollment penalty. However, if you were paying a penalty before joining our plan,
you may not have another chance to request a review of that late enrollment penalty.
Important: Do not stop paying your Part D late enrollment penalty while you’re waiting
for a review of the decision about your late enrollment penalty. If you do, you could
be disenrolled for failure to pay your plan premiums.

*Section 4.4 Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount
Some members may be required to pay an extra charge, known as the Part D Income
Related Monthly Adjustment Amount, also known as IRMAA. The extra charge is figured
out using your modified adjusted gross income as reported on your IRS tax return
from 2 years ago. If this amount is above a certain amount, you’ll pay the standard
premium amount and the additional IRMAA. For more information on the extra amount
you may have to pay based on your income, visit https://www.medicare.gov/drug-
coverage-part-d/costs-for-medicare-drug-coverage/monthly-premium-for-drug-plans.
If you have to pay an extra amount, Social Security, not your Medicare plan, will send
you a letter telling you what that extra amount will be. The extra amount will be
withheld from your Social Security, Railroad Retirement Board, or Office of Personnel
Management benefit check, no matter how you usually pay your plan premium, unless
your monthly benefit isn’t enough to cover the extra amount owed. If your benefit
check isn’t enough to cover the extra amount, you will get a bill from Medicare. You
must pay the extra amount to the government. It cannot be paid with your
monthly plan premium. If you do not pay the extra amount you will be
disenrolled from the plan and lose prescription drug coverage.
If you disagree about paying an extra amount, you can ask Social Security to review
the decision. To find out more about how to do this, contact Social Security at
1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5 More information about your monthly premium

*Section 5.1 There are several ways you can pay your plan premium
There are 4 ways you can pay your plan premium.
Option 1: Paying by check
You will receive a monthly notice indicating when the premium is due. Your premium
st
is due in our office by the 1 day of the month. Checks should be made payable to
Blue Cross MedicareRx and should be mailed to:
Blue Cross MedicareRx
P.O. Box 268845
Oklahoma City, OK 73126-8845
To send payments overnight, please mail to:
Blue Cross MedicareRx
3232 West Reno
Lockbox #268845
Oklahoma City, OK 73107
Option 2: You can pay via automatic withdrawal
Instead of paying by check, you can have your monthly plan premium automatically
withdrawn from your bank account. Automatic withdrawals of the premium from
th
your bank account will take place on a monthly basis on approximately the 4 day of
each month. You can request an ACH form to set up automatic withdrawals from your
bank account by contacting Customer Service or visiting our website, getbluenm.com/
pdp.
Option 3: Check Payment by Phone
You can make an expedited premium payment by phone. Call 1-866-398-9054 to
complete a check payment by phone.
Option 4: Having your premium taken out of your monthly Social Security check
Changing the way you pay your premium. If you decide to change the way you pay
your premium, it can take up to three months for your new payment method to take
effect. While we are processing your request for a new payment method, you are
responsible for making sure that your plan premium is paid on time. To change your
premium contact Customer Service for more information on how to pay your monthly
plan premium this way. We will be happy to help you set this up.
What to do if you are having trouble paying your plan premium
st
Your plan premium is due in our office by the 1 day of the month. If we have not
th
received your premium by the 5 day of the month, we will send you a notice telling
you that your plan membership will end if we do not receive your premium payment
within 90 days.
If you are having trouble paying your premium on time, please contact Customer
Service to see if we can direct you to programs that will help with your plan premium.
If we end your membership because you did not pay your premiums, you will still
have health coverage under Original Medicare.
If we end your membership with the plan because you did not pay your premiums,
and you don’t currently have prescription drug coverage then you may not be able to
receive Part D coverage until the following year if you enroll in a new plan during the
annual enrollment period. During the annual Medicare open enrollment period, you
may either join a stand-alone prescription drug plan or a health plan that also provides
drug coverage. (If you go without "creditable" drug coverage for more than 63 days,
you may have to pay a Part D late enrollment penalty for as long as you have Part D
coverage.)
At the time we end your membership, you may still owe us for premiums you have
not paid. We have the right to pursue collection of the premiums you owe. In the
future, if you want to enroll again in our plan (or another plan that we offer), you will
need to pay the amount you owe before you can enroll.
If you think we have wrongfully ended your membership, you can make a complaint
(also called a grievance); see Chapter 7 for how to file a complaint. If you had an
emergency circumstance that was out of your control and it caused you to not be able
to pay your plan premium within our grace period, you can make a complaint. For
complaints, we will review our decision again. Chapter 7, Section 7 of this document
tells how to make a complaint or you can call us at 1-888-285-2249 between 8:00 a.m.
– 8:00 p.m., local time, 7 days a week. If you are calling from April 1 through September
30, alternate technologies (for example, voicemail) will be used on weekends and
holidays. TTY users should call 711. You must make your request no later than 60
days after the date your membership ends.

*Section 5.2 Can we change your monthly plan premium during the year?
No. We are not allowed to change the amount we charge for the plan’s monthly plan
premium during the year. If the monthly plan premium changes for next year we will
tell you in September and the change will take effect on January 1.
However, in some cases the part of the premium that you have to pay can change
during the year. This happens if you become eligible for the “Extra Help” program or
if you lose your eligibility for the “Extra Help” program during the year. If a member
qualifies for “Extra Help” with their prescription drug costs, the “Extra Help” program
will pay part of the member’s monthly plan premium. A member who loses their
eligibility during the year will need to start paying their full monthly premium. You
can find out more about the “Extra Help” program in Chapter 2, Section 7.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6 Keeping your plan membership record up to date
Your membership record has information from your enrollment form, including your
address and telephone number. It shows your specific plan coverage.
The pharmacists in the plan’s network need to have correct information about
you. These network providers use your membership record to know what drugs
are covered and the cost-sharing amounts for you. Because of this, it is very
important that you help us keep your information up to date.
Let us know about these changes:
Changes to your name, your address, or your phone number
Changes in any other medical or drug insurance coverage you have (such as
from your employer, your spouse’s employer, workers’ compensation, or
Medicaid)
If you have any liability claims, such as claims from an automobile accident
If you have been admitted to a nursing home
If your designated responsible party (such as a caregiver) changes
If any of this information changes, please let us know by calling Customer Service.
It is also important to contact Social Security if you move or change your mailing
address. You can find phone numbers and contact information for Social Security in
Chapter 2, Section 5.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 7 How other insurance works with our plan
Other insurance
Medicare requires that we collect information from you about any other medical or
drug insurance coverage that you have. That’s because we must coordinate any other
coverage you have with your benefits under our plan. This is called Coordination of
Benefits.
Once each year, we will send you a letter that lists any other medical or drug insurance
coverage that we know about. Please read over this information carefully. If it is correct,
you don’t need to do anything. If the information is incorrect, or if you have other
coverage that is not listed, please call Customer Service. You may need to give your
plan member ID number to your other insurers (once you have confirmed their identity)
so your bills are paid correctly and on time.
When you have other insurance (like employer group health coverage), there are rules
set by Medicare that decide whether our plan or your other insurance pays first. The
insurance that pays first is called the “primary payer” and pays up to the limits of its
coverage. The one that pays second, called the “secondary payer,” only pays if there
are costs left uncovered by the primary coverage. The secondary payer may not pay
all of the uncovered costs. If you have other insurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and
pharmacy.
These rules apply for employer or union group health plan coverage:
If you have retiree coverage, Medicare pays first.
If your group health plan coverage is based on your or a family member’s
current employment, who pays first depends on your age, the number of
people employed by your employer, and whether you have Medicare based
on age, disability, or End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD):
If you’re under 65 and disabled and you or your family member is still
working, your group health plan pays first if the employer has 100 or
more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan
that has more than 100 employees.
If you’re over 65 and you or your spouse is still working, your group health
plan pays first if the employer has 20 or more employees or at least one
employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 20 employees.
If you have Medicare because of ESRD, your group health plan will pay first
for the first 30 months after you become eligible for Medicare.
These types of coverage usually pay first for services related to each type:
No-fault insurance (including automobile insurance)
Liability (including automobile insurance)
Black lung benefits
Workers’ compensation
Medicaid and TRICARE never pay first for Medicare-covered services. They only pay
after Medicare, employer group health plans, and/or Medigap have paid.
If you have other insurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and pharmacy. If you have
questions about who pays first, or you need to update your other insurance
information, call Customer Service (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of
this booklet). You may need to give your plan member ID number to your other
insurers (once you have confirmed their identity) so your bills are paid correctly and
on time.
