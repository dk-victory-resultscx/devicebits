SECTION 1 Introduction
This chapter explains rules for using your coverage for Part D drugs.
In addition to your coverage for Part D drugs through our plan, Original Medicare
(Medicare Part A and Part B) also covers some drugs:
Medicare Part A covers drugs you are given during Medicare-covered stays
in the hospital or in a skilled nursing facility.
Medicare Part B also provides benefits for some drugs. Part B drugs include
certain chemotherapy drugs, certain drug injections you are given during an
office visit, and drugs you are given at a dialysis facility.
The two examples of drugs described above are covered by Original Medicare. (To
find out more about this coverage, see your Medicare & You 2023 handbook.) Your
Part D prescription drugs are covered under our plan.

*Section 1.1 Basic rules for the plan’s Part D drug coverage
The plan will generally cover your drugs as long as you follow these basic rules:
You must have a provider (a doctor, dentist, or other prescriber) write you a
prescription which must be valid under applicable state law.
Your prescriber must not be on Medicare’s Exclusion or Preclusion Lists.
You generally must use a network pharmacy to fill your prescription. (See
Section 2, Fill your prescriptions at a network pharmacy or through the plan’s
mail-order service).
Your drug must be on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) (we call it
the "Drug List" for short). (See Section 3, Your drugs need to be on the plan’s
"Drug List").
Your drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. A "medically
accepted indication" is a use of the drug that is either approved by the Food
and Drug Administration or supported by certain reference books. (See
Section 3 for more information about a medically accepted indication.)
