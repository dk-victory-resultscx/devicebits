CHAPTER 3:
Using the plan's coverage for Part D
prescription drugs

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 Introduction
This chapter explains rules for using your coverage for Part D drugs.
In addition to your coverage for Part D drugs through our plan, Original Medicare
(Medicare Part A and Part B) also covers some drugs:
Medicare Part A covers drugs you are given during Medicare-covered stays
in the hospital or in a skilled nursing facility.
Medicare Part B also provides benefits for some drugs. Part B drugs include
certain chemotherapy drugs, certain drug injections you are given during an
office visit, and drugs you are given at a dialysis facility.
The two examples of drugs described above are covered by Original Medicare. (To
find out more about this coverage, see your Medicare & You 2023 handbook.) Your
Part D prescription drugs are covered under our plan.

*Section 1.1 Basic rules for the plan’s Part D drug coverage
The plan will generally cover your drugs as long as you follow these basic rules:
You must have a provider (a doctor, dentist, or other prescriber) write you a
prescription which must be valid under applicable state law.
Your prescriber must not be on Medicare’s Exclusion or Preclusion Lists.
You generally must use a network pharmacy to fill your prescription. (See
Section 2, Fill your prescriptions at a network pharmacy or through the plan’s
mail-order service).
Your drug must be on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) (we call it
the "Drug List" for short). (See Section 3, Your drugs need to be on the plan’s
"Drug List").
Your drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. A "medically
accepted indication" is a use of the drug that is either approved by the Food
and Drug Administration or supported by certain reference books. (See
Section 3 for more information about a medically accepted indication.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 Fill your prescription at a network pharmacy or through
the plan’s mail-order service

*Section 2.1 Use a network pharmacy
In most cases, your prescriptions are covered only if they are filled at the plan’s network
pharmacies. (See Section 2.5 for information about when we would cover prescriptions
filled at out-of-network pharmacies.)
A network pharmacy is a pharmacy that has a contract with the plan to provide your
covered prescription drugs. The term “covered drugs” means all of the Part D
prescription drugs that are on the plan’s Drug List.

*Section 2.2 Network pharmacies
How do you find a network pharmacy in your area?
To find a network pharmacy, you can look in your Pharmacy Directory, visit our website
(getbluenm.com/pdp), and/or call Customer Service.
You may go to any of our network pharmacies. Some of our network pharmacies
provide preferred cost sharing, which may be lower than the cost sharing at a pharmacy
that offers standard cost sharing. The Pharmacy Directory will tell you which of the
network pharmacies offer preferred cost sharing. The Pharmacy Directory will tell you
which of the network pharmacies offer preferred cost sharing. Contact us to find out
more about how your out-of-pocket costs could vary for different drugs.
What if the pharmacy you have been using leaves the network?
If the pharmacy you have been using leaves the plan’s network, you will have to find
a new pharmacy that is in the network. Or if the pharmacy you have been using stays
within the network but is no longer offering preferred cost sharing, you may want to
switch to a different network or preferred pharmacy,if available. To find another
pharmacy in your area, you can get help from Customer Service or use the Pharmacy
Directory. You can also find information on our website at getbluenm.com/pdp.
What if you need a specialized pharmacy?
Some prescriptions must be filled at a specialized pharmacy. Specialized pharmacies
include:
Pharmacies that supply drugs for home infusion therapy.
Pharmacies that supply drugs for residents of a long-term care (LTC) facility.
Usually, a LTC facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy. If you
have any difficulty accessing your Part D benefits in an LTC facility, please
contact Customer Service.
Pharmacies that serve the Indian Health Service / Tribal / Urban Indian Health
Program (not available in Puerto Rico). Except in emergencies, only Native
Americans or Alaska Natives have access to these pharmacies in our network.
Pharmacies that dispense drugs that are restricted by the FDA to certain
locations or that require special handling, provider coordination, or education
on their use. (Note: This scenario should happen rarely.)
To locate a specialized pharmacy, look in your Pharmacy Directory or call Customer
Service.

*Section 2.3 Using the plan’s mail-order service
Our plan’s mail-order service allows you to order up to a 90-day supply.
To get information about filling your prescriptions by mail, contact one of our
mail-order services: AllianceRx Walgreens Pharmacy at 1-888-277-5475 (TTY 711), or
Express Scripts® Pharmacy at 1-833-715-0944 (TTY 711). You can also visit www.
alliancerxwp.com/home-delivery or express-scripts.com/rx.
See Chapter 4, Sections 5.2 and 5.4 for preferred and standard cost-sharing amounts
at mail-order pharmacies.
Usually a mail-order pharmacy order will be delivered to you in no more than 10 days.
To refill your mail order prescriptions, please contact us 10 to 20 days before you
think the drugs you have on hand will run out to make sure your next order is shipped
to you in time.
If a mail-order delay exists and you are in jeopardy of therapy interruption,
your plan allows for mail delay override. Please call Customer Service to get
an override approval. Once approval is received, the mail-order pharmacy
will transfer your prescription to the pharmacy of your choice or have your
prescriber telephone a shorter supply to a local retail pharmacy.
New prescriptions the pharmacy receives directly from your doctor’s office.
The pharmacy will automatically fill and deliver new prescriptions it receives from
health care providers, without checking with you first, if either:
You used mail-order services with this plan in the past, or
You sign up for automatic delivery of all new prescriptions received directly
from health care providers. You may request automatic delivery of all new
prescriptions at any time by contacting your mail order pharmacy to set up
automatic refills for your prescriptions.
If you receive a prescription automatically by mail that you do not want, and you
were not contacted to see if you wanted it before it shipped, you may be eligible
for a refund.
If you used mail order in the past and do not want the pharmacy to automatically
fill and ship each new prescription, please contact us by logging into your online
account or by contacting the pharmacy directly.
If you have never used our mail-order delivery and/or decide to stop automatic fills
of new prescriptions, the pharmacy will contact you each time it gets a new prescription
from a health care provider to see if you want the medication filled and shipped
immediately. It is important that you respond each time you are contacted by the
pharmacy, to let them know whether to ship, delay, or cancel the new prescription.
Refills on mail-order prescriptions. For refills of your drugs, you have the option
to sign up for an automatic refill program. Under this program we will start to
process your next refill automatically when our records show you should be close
to running out of your drug. The pharmacy will contact you prior to shipping each
refill to make sure you are in need of more medication, and you can cancel
scheduled refills if you have enough of your medication or if your medication has
changed.
If you choose not to use our auto-refill program but still want the mail-order
pharmacy to send you your prescription, please contact your pharmacy 10 days
days before your current prescription will run out. This will ensure your order is
shipped to you in time.
To opt out of our program that automatically prepares mail-order refills, please
contact us by logging into your online account or by contacting the pharmacy
directly.
If you receive a refill automatically by mail that you do not want, you may be eligible
for a refund.

*Section 2.4 How can you get a long-term supply of drugs?
The plan offers two ways to get a long-term supply (also called an “extended supply”)
of “maintenance” drugs on our plan’s Drug List. (Maintenance drugs are drugs that
you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or long-term medical condition.)
1. Some retail pharmacies in our network allow you to get a long-term supply
of maintenance drugs. Your Pharmacy Directory tells you which pharmacies
in our network can give you a long-term supply of maintenance drugs. You
can also call Customer Service for more information.
2. You may also receive maintenance drugs through our mail-order program.
Please see Section 2.3 for more information.

*Section 2.5 When can you use a pharmacy that is not in the plan’s network?
Your prescription may be covered in certain situations
Generally, we cover drugs filled at an out-of-network pharmacy only when you are
not able to use a network pharmacy. To help you, we have network pharmacies outside
of our service area where you can get your prescriptions filled as a member of our
plan. Please check first with Customer Service to see if there is a network pharmacy
nearby. You will most likely be required to pay the difference between what you pay
for the drug at the out-of-network pharmacy and the cost that we would cover at an
in-network pharmacy.
Here are the circumstances when we would cover prescriptions filled at an
out-of-network pharmacy:
If the member is traveling outside his or her plan’s service area and:
he/she runs out of or loses his or her covered Part D drugs; or
becomes ill and needs a covered Part D drug; or
cannot access a network pharmacy.
If the member is unable to obtain a covered Part D drug in a timely manner
within his or her service area because, for example, there is no network
pharmacy within a reasonable driving distance that provides 24/7 service;
If the member is filling a prescription for a covered Part D drug and that
particular drug (for example, an orphan drug or other specialty
pharmaceutical) is not regularly stocked at an accessible network retail or
mail-order pharmacy;
If the member is provided with covered Part D drugs dispensed by an
out-of-network institution-based pharmacy while the beneficiary is in an
emergency department, provider-based clinic, outpatient surgery, or other
outpatient setting.
During any Federal disaster declaration or other public health emergency
declaration in which Part D enrollees are evacuated or otherwise displaced
from their place of residence and cannot reasonably be expected to obtain
covered Part D drugs at a network pharmacy. In addition, in circumstances
in which normal distribution channels are unavailable.
Refill prescriptions for routine or maintenance drugs filled at out-of-network
pharmacies in a NON-emergency situation or unusual circumstances, will
not be available for coverage under your Medicare Part D benefit.
In addition, Blue Cross MedicareRx will not routinely allow for more than a
month’s supply of medication to be dispensed at an out-of-network pharmacy,
although Blue Cross MedicareRx may override the one-month limit on a
case-by-case basis when warranted by extraordinary circumstances.
You can locate all of the Blue Cross MedicareRx participating pharmacies in
your area on our website at getbluenm.com/pdp/pharmacies or by calling
the Pharmacy Locator line at 1-877-800-0746, answered 24 hours a day, 365
days a year. TTY users call 711, answered 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
How do you ask for reimbursement from the plan?
If you must use an out-of-network pharmacy, you will generally have to pay the full
cost (rather than your normal cost share) at the time you fill your prescription. You
can ask us to reimburse you for our share of the cost. (Chapter 5, Section 2 explains
how to ask the plan to pay you back.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 Your drugs need to be on the plan’s “Drug List”

*Section 3.1 The “Drug List” tells which Part D drugs are covered
The plan has a "List of Covered Drugs (Formulary)." In this Evidence of Coverage, we call
it the "Drug List" for short.
The drugs on this list are selected by the plan with the help of a team of doctors and
pharmacists. The list meets Medicare's requirements and has been approved by
Medicare.
The drugs on the Drug List are only those covered under Medicare Part D.
We will generally cover a drug on the plan’s Drug List as long as you follow the other
coverage rules explained in this chapter and the use of the drug is a medically accepted
indication. A “medically accepted indication” is a use of the drug that is either:
Approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis or condition
for which it is being prescribed.
-- or -- Supported by certain references, such as the American Hospital
Formulary Service Drug Information and the DRUGDEX Information System.
The Drug List includes brand name drugs, generic drugs, and biosimilars.
A brand name drug is a prescription drug that is sold under a trademarked name
owned by the drug manufacturer. Brand name drugs that are more complex than
typical drugs (for example, drugs that are based on a protein) are called biological
products. On the drug list, when we refer to “drugs,” this could mean a drug or a
biological product.
A generic drug is a prescription drug that has the same active ingredients as the brand
name drug. Since biological products are more complex than typical drugs, instead
of having a generic form, they have alternatives that are called biosimilars. Generally,
generics and biosimilars work just as well as the brand name drug or biological product
and usually cost less. There are generic drug substitutes or biosimilar alternatives
available for many brand name drugs and some biological products.
What is not on the Drug List?
The plan does not cover all prescription drugs.
In some cases, the law does not allow any Medicare plan to cover certain
types of drugs (for more about this, see Section 7.1 in this chapter).
In other cases, we have decided not to include a particular drug on the Drug
List. In some cases, you may be able to obtain a drug that is not on the drug
list. For more information, please see Chapter 9.

*Section 3.2 There are 5 “cost-sharing tiers” for drugs on the Drug List
Every drug on the plan’s Drug List is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher
the cost-sharing tier, the higher your cost for the drug:
Tier 1 Preferred Generic (Lowest Tier)
Tier 2 Generic
Tier 3 Preferred Brand
Tier 4 Non-Preferred Drug
Tier 5 Specialty Tier (Highest Tier)
To find out which cost-sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in the plan’s Drug List.
The amount you pay for drugs in each cost-sharing tier is shown in Chapter 4 (What
you pay for your Part D prescription drugs).

*Section 3.3 How can you find out if a specific drug is on the Drug List?
You have 3 ways to find out:
1. Check the most recent Drug List we provided electronically.
2. Visit the plan’s website (getbluenm.com/pdp). The Drug List on the website
is always the most current.
3. Call Customer Service to find out if a particular drug is on the plan’s Drug List
or to ask for a copy of the list.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 There are restrictions on coverage for some drugs

*Section 4.1 Why do some drugs have restrictions?
For certain prescription drugs, special rules restrict how and when the plan covers
them. A team of doctors and pharmacists developed these rules to encourage you
and your provider to use drugs in the most effective way. To find out if any of these
restrictions apply to a drug you take or want to take, check the Drug List
Please note that sometimes a drug may appear more than once in our drug list. This
is because the same drugs can differ based on the strength, amount, or form of the
drug prescribed by your health care provider, and different restrictions or cost sharing
may apply to the different versions of the drug (for instance, 10 mg versus 100 mg;
one per day versus two per day; tablet versus liquid).

*Section 4.2 What kinds of restrictions?
The sections below tell you more about the types of restrictions we use for certain
drugs.
If there is a restriction for your drug, it usually means that you or your provider
will have to take extra steps in order for us to cover the drug. Contact Customer
Service to learn what you or your provider would need to do to get coverage for the
drug. If you want us to waive the restriction for you, you will need to use the coverage
decision process and ask us to make an exception. We may or may not agree to waive
the restriction for you. (See Chapter 9)
Restricting brand name drugs when a generic version is available
Generally, a “generic” drug works the same as a brand name drug and usually costs
less. In most cases, when a generic version of a brand name drug is available,
our network pharmacies will provide you the generic version instead ofthe
brand name drug. However, if your provider has told us the medical reason that
neither the generic drug nor other covered drugs that treat the same condition will
work for you, then we will cover the brand name drug. (Your share of the cost may
be greater for the brand name drug than for the generic drug.)
Getting plan approval in advance
For certain drugs, you or your provider need to get approval from the plan before we
will agree to cover the drug for you. This is called “prior authorization.” This is put
in place to ensure medication safety and help guide appropriate use of certain drugs.
If you do not get this approval, your drug might not be covered by the plan.
Trying a different drug first
This requirement encourages you to try less costly but usually just as effective drugs
before the plan covers another drug. For example, if Drug A and Drug B treat the
same medical condition, the plan may require you to try Drug A first. If Drug A does
not work for you, the plan will then cover Drug B. This requirement to try a different
drug first is called “step therapy.”
Quantity limits
For certain drugs, we limit how much of a drug you can get each time you fill your
prescription. For example, if it is normally considered safe to take only one pill per
day for a certain drug, we may limit coverage for your prescription to no more than
one pill per day.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5 What if one of your drugs is not covered in the way you’d
like it to be covered?

*Section 5.1 There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the
way you’d like it to be covered
There are situations where there is a prescription drug you are taking, or one that
you and your provider think you should be taking that is not on our formulary or is
on our formulary with restrictions. For example:
The drug might not be covered at all. Or maybe a generic version of the drug
is covered but the brand name version you want to take is not covered.
The drug is covered, but there are extra rules or restrictions on coverage for
that drug, as explained in Section 4.
The drug is covered, but it is in a cost-sharing tier that makes your cost sharing
more expensive than you think it should be.
There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way that you’d
like it to be covered. If your drug is not on the Drug List or if your drug is
restricted, go to Section 5.2 to learn what you can do.

*Section 5.2 What can you do if your drug is not on the Drug List or if the drug
is restricted in some way?
If your drug is not on the Drug List or is restricted, here are options:
You may be able to get a temporary supply of the drug.
You can change to another drug.
You can request an exception and ask the plan to cover the drug or remove
restrictions from the drug.
You may be able to get a temporary supply
Under certain circumstances, the plan must provide a temporary supply of a drug
that you are already taking. This temporary supply gives you time to talk with your
provider about the change in coverage and decide what to do.
To be eligible for a temporary supply, the drug you have been taking must no longer
be on the plan’s Drug List OR is now restricted in some way.
If you are a new member, we will cover a temporary supply of your drug
during the first 90 days of your membership in the plan.
If you were in the plan last year, we will cover a temporary supply of your
drug during the first 90 days of the calendar year.
This temporary supply will be for a maximum of a 30-day supply. If your
prescription is written for fewer days, we will allow multiple fills to provide
up to a maximum of a 30-day supply of medication. The prescription must
be filled at a network pharmacy. (Please note that the long-term care
pharmacy may provide the drug in smaller amounts at a time to prevent
waste.)
For those members who have been in the plan for more than 90 days
and reside in a long-term care facility and need a supply right away:
We will cover one 31-day emergency supply of a particular drug, or less if your
prescription is written for fewer days. This is in addition to the above temporary
supply.
For questions about a temporary supply, call Customer Service.
During the time when you are using a temporary supply of a drug, you should talk
with your provider to decide what to do when your temporary supply runs out. You
have two options.
1) You can change to another drug
Talk with your provider about whether there is a different drug covered by the plan
that may work just as well for you. You can call Customer Service to ask for a list of
covered drugs that treat the same medical condition. This list can help your provider
find a covered drug that might work for you.
2) You can ask for an exception
You and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception and cover the drug in
the way you would like it covered. If your provider says that you have medical reasons
that justify asking us for an exception, your provider can help you request an exception.
For example, you can ask the plan to cover a drug even though it is not on the plan’s
Drug List. Or you can ask the plan to make an exception and cover the drug without
restrictions.
If you are a current member and a drug you are taking will be removed from the
formulary or restricted in some way for next year, we will tell you about any change
prior to the new year. You can ask for an exception before next year, and we will give
you an answer within 72 hours after we receive your request (or your prescriber’s
supporting statement). If we approve your request, we will authorize the coverage
before the change takes effect.
If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 7, Section 5.4 tells you
what to do. It explains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare
to make sure your request is handled promptly and fairly.

*Section 5.3 What can you do if your drug is in a cost-sharing tier you think
is too high?
If your drug is in a cost-sharing tier you think is too high, here are things you can do:
You can change to another drug
If your drug is in a cost-sharing tier you think is too high, talk to your provider. There
may be a different drug in a lower cost-sharing tier that might work just as well for
you. You can call Customer Service to ask for a list of covered drugs that treat the
same medical condition. This list can help your provider find a covered drug that might
work for you.
You can ask for an exception
You and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception in the cost-sharing tier
for the drug so that you pay less for it. If your provider says that you have medical
reasons that justify asking us for an exception, your provider can help you request
an exception to the rule.
If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 7, Section 5.4 tells what
to do. It explains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare to
make sure your request is handled promptly and fairly.
Drugs in our Specialty Tier 5 are not eligible for this type of exception. We do not lower
the cost-sharing amount for drugs in this tier.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6 What if your coverage changes for one of your drugs?

*Section 6.1 The Drug List can change during the year
Most of the changes in drug coverage happen at the beginning of each year ( January
1). However, during the year, the plan can make some changes to the Drug List. For
example, the plan might:
Add or remove drugs from the Drug List.
Move a drug to a higher or lower cost-sharing tier.
Add or remove a restriction on coverage for a drug.
Replace a brand name drug with a generic drug.
We must follow Medicare requirements before we change the plan’s Drug List.

*Section 6.2 What happens if coverage changes for a drug you are taking?
Information on changes to drug coverage
When changes to the Drug List occur, we post information on our website about those
changes. We also update our online Drug List on a regularly scheduled basis. Below
we point out the times that you would get direct notice if changes are made to a drug
that you are taking.
Changes to your drug coverage that affect you during the current plan year
A new generic drug replaces a brand name drug on the Drug List (or we
change the cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions to the brand name
drug or both)
We may immediately remove a brand name drug on our Drug List if we
are replacing it with a newly approved generic version of the same drug.
The generic drug will appear on the same or lower cost-sharing tier and
with the same or fewer restrictions. We may decide to keep the brand
name drug on our Drug List, but immediately move it to a higher
cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions or both when the new generic
is added.
We may not tell you in advance before we make that change—even if
you are currently taking the brand name drug. If you are taking the brand
name drug at the time we make the change, we will provide you with
information about the specific change(s). This will also include information
on the steps you may take to request an exception to cover the brand
name drug. You may not get this notice before we make the change.
You or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to
cover the brand name drug for you. For information on how to ask for
an exception, see Chapter 7.
Unsafe drugs and other drugs on the Drug List that are withdrawn from
the market
Once in a while, a drug may be suddenly withdrawn because it has been
found to be unsafe or removed from the market for another reason. If
this happens, we will immediately remove the drug from the Drug List.
If you are taking that drug, we will let you know of this change right away.
Your prescriber will also know about this change, and can work with you
to find another drug for your condition.
Other changes to drugs on the Drug List
We may make other changes once the year has started that affect drugs
you are taking. For example, we might add a generic drug that is not new
to the market to replace a brand name drug on the Drug List or change
the cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions to the brand name drug or
both. We also might make changes based on FDA boxed warnings or
new clinical guidelines recognized by Medicare.
For these changes, we must give you at least 30 days’ advance notice of
the change or give you notice of the change and a 30-day refill of the
drug you are taking at a network pharmacy.
After you receive notice of the change, you should work with your
provider to switch to a different drug that we cover or to satisfy any new
restrictions on the drug you are taking.
You or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to
cover the drug for you. For information on how to ask for an exception,
see Chapter 7.
Changes to the Drug List that do not affect you during the plan year
We may make certain changes to the Drug List that are not described above. In these
cases, the change will not apply to you if you are taking the drug when the change is
made; however, these changes will likely affect you starting January 1 of the next plan
year if you stay in the same plan.
In general, changes that will not affect you during the current plan year are:
We move your drug into a higher cost-sharing tier.
We put a new restriction on the use of your drug.
We remove your drug from the Drug List.
If any of these changes happen for a drug you are taking (except for market withdrawal,
a generic drug replacing a brand name drug, or other change noted in the sections
above), then the change won’t affect your use or what you pay as your share of the
cost until January 1 of the next year. Until that date, you probably won’t see any
increase in your payments or any added restrictions to your use of the drug.
We will not tell you about these types of changes directly during the current plan year.
You will need to check the Drug List for the next plan year (when the list is available
during the open enrollment period) to see if there are any changes to the drugs you
are taking that will impact you during the next plan year.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 7 What types of drugs are not covered by the plan?

*Section 7.1 Types of drugs we do not cover
This section tells you what kinds of prescription drugs are "excluded." This means
Medicare does not pay for these drugs.
If you get drugs that are excluded, you must pay for them yourself. If you appeal and
the requested drug is found not to be excluded under Part D, we will pay for or cover
it. (For information about appealing a decision, go to Chapter 7, Section 5.5.)
Here are three general rules about drugs that Medicare drug plans will not cover
under Part D:
Our plan’s Part D drug coverage cannot cover a drug that would be covered
under Medicare Part A or Part B.
Our plan cannot cover a drug purchased outside the United States or its
territories.
Our plan usually cannot cover off-label use. "Off-label use" is any use of the
drug other than those indicated on a drug’s label as approved by the Food
and Drug Administration.
Coverage for "off-label use" is allowed only when the use is supported by
certain references, such as the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug
Information and the DRUGDEX Information System.
In addition, by law, the following categories of drugs are not covered by Medicare
drug plans:
Non-prescription drugs (also called over-the-counter drugs)
Drugs used to promote fertility
Drugs used for the relief of cough or cold symptoms
Drugs used for cosmetic purposes or to promote hair growth
Prescription vitamins and mineral products, except prenatal vitamins and
fluoride preparations
Drugs used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction
Drugs used for treatment of anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain
Outpatient drugs for which the manufacturer seeks to require that associated
tests or monitoring services be purchased exclusively from the manufacturer
as a condition of sale
In addition, if you are receiving “Extra Help” to pay for your prescriptions, the “Extra
Help” program will not pay for the drugs not normally covered. However, if you have
drug coverage through Medicaid, your state Medicaid program may cover some
prescription drugs not normally covered in a Medicare drug plan. Please contact your
state Medicaid program to determine what drug coverage may be available to you.
(You can find phone numbers and contact information for Medicaid in Chapter 2,
Section 6.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 8 Filling a prescription

*Section 8.1 Provide your membership information
To fill your prescription, provide your plan membership information, which can be
found on your membership card, at the network pharmacy you choose. The network
pharmacy will automatically bill the plan for our share of your drug cost. You will need
to pay the pharmacy your share of the cost when you pick up your prescription.

*Section 8.2 What if you don’t have your membership information with you?
If you don’t have your plan membership information with you when you fill your
prescription, you or the pharmacy can call the plan to get the necessary information.
If the pharmacy is not able to get the necessary information, you may have to pay
the full cost of the prescription when you pick it up. (You can then ask us to
reimburse you for our share. See Chapter 5, Section 2 for information about how to
ask the plan for reimbursement.)

SECTION 9 Part D drug coverage in special situations

*Section 9.1 What if you’re in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility?
If you are admitted to a hospital or to a skilled nursing facility for a stay covered by
the plan, we will generally cover the cost of your prescription drugs during your stay.
Once you leave the hospital or skilled nursing facility, the plan will cover your
prescription drugs as long as the drugs meet all of our rules for coverage described
in this Chapter.

*Section 9.2 What if you’re a resident in a long-term care (LTC) facility?
Usually, a long-term care (LTC) facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy,
or uses a pharmacy that supplies drugs for all of its residents. If you are a resident of
a LTC facility, you may get your prescription drugs through the facility’s pharmacy or
the one it uses, as long as it is part of our network.
Check your Pharmacy Directory to find out if your LTC facility’s pharmacy or the one
that it uses is part of our network. If it isn’t, or if you need more information or
assistance, please contact Customer Service. If you are in an LTC facility, we must
ensure that you are able to routinely receive your Part D benefits through our network
of LTC pharmacies.
What if you’re a resident in a long-term care (LTC) facility and need a drug that
is not on our Drug List or is restricted in some way?
Please refer to Section 5.2 about a temporary or emergency supply.

*Section 9.3 What if you are taking drugs covered by Original Medicare?
Your enrollment in Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) doesn’t affect your coverage
for drugs covered under Medicare Part A or Part B. If you meet Medicare’s coverage
requirements, your drug will still be covered under Medicare Part A or Part B, even
though you are enrolled in this plan. In addition, if your drug would be covered by
Medicare Part A or Part B, our plan can’t cover it, even if you choose not to enroll in
Part A or Part B.
Some drugs may be covered under Medicare Part B in some situations and through
Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) in other situations. But drugs are never covered
by both Part B and our plan at the same time. In general, your pharmacist or provider
will determine whether to bill Medicare Part B or Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP)
for the drug.

*Section 9.4 What if you have a Medigap (Medicare Supplement Insurance)
policy with prescription drug coverage?
If you currently have a Medigap policy that includes coverage for prescription drugs,
you must contact your Medigap issuer and tell them you have enrolled in our plan. If
you decide to keep your current Medigap policy, your Medigap issuer will remove the
prescription drug coverage portion of your Medigap policy and lower your premium.
Each year your Medigap insurance company should send you a notice that tells if your
prescription drug coverage is “creditable,” and the choices you have for drug coverage.
(If the coverage from the Medigap policy is “creditable,” it means that it is expected
to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage.)
The notice will also explain how much your premium would be lowered if you remove
the prescription drug coverage portion of your Medigap policy. If you didn’t get this
notice, or if you can’t find it, contact your Medigap insurance company and ask for
another copy.

*Section 9.5 What if you’re also getting drug coverage from an employer or
retiree group plan?
If you currently have other prescription drug coverage through your (or your spouse’s)
employer or retiree group, please contact that group’s benefits administrator. He or
she can help you determine how your current prescription drug coverage will work
with our plan.
In general, if you have employee or retiree group coverage, the drug coverage you
get from us will be secondary to your group coverage. That means your group coverage
would pay first.
Special note about ‘creditable coverage’:
Each year your employer or retiree group should send you a notice that tells if your
prescription drug coverage for the next calendar year is “creditable.”
If the coverage from the group plan is “creditable,” it means that the plan has drug
coverage that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard
prescription drug coverage.
Keep this notice about creditable coverage, because you may need them later. If
you enroll in a Medicare plan that includes Part D drug coverage, you may need these
notices to show that you have maintained creditable coverage. If you didn’t get the
creditable coverage notice, request a copy from the employer or retiree group’s
benefits administrator or the employer or union.

*Section 9.6 What if you are in Medicare-certified Hospice?
Hospice and our plan do not cover the same drug at the same time. If you are enrolled
in Medicare hospice and require certain drugs (e.g., anti-nausea, laxative, pain
medication or antianxiety drugs) that are not covered by your hospice because it is
unrelated to your terminal illness and related conditions, our plan must receive
notification from either the prescriber or your hospice provider that the drug is
unrelated before our plan can cover the drug. To prevent delays in receiving these
drugs that should be covered by our plan, ask your hospice provider or prescriber to
provide notification before your prescription is filled.
In the event you either revoke your hospice election or are discharged from hospice,
our plan should cover your drugs as explained in this document. To prevent any delays
at a pharmacy when your Medicare hospice benefit ends, bring documentation to the
pharmacy to verify your revocation or discharge.

SECTION 10 Programs on drug safety and managing medications

*Section 10.1 Programs to help members use drugs safely
We conduct drug use reviews for our members to help make sure that they are getting
safe and appropriate care.
We do a review each time you fill a prescription. We also review our records on a
regular basis. During these reviews, we look for potential problems such as:
Possible medication errors
Drugs that may not be necessary because you are taking another drug to
treat the same condition
Drugs that may not be safe or appropriate because of your age or gender
Certain combinations of drugs that could harm you if taken at the same time
Prescriptions for drugs that have ingredients you are allergic to
Possible errors in the amount (dosage) of a drug you are taking
Unsafe amounts of opioid pain medications
If we see a possible problem in your use of medications, we will work with your provider
to correct the problem.

*Section 10.2 Drug Management Program (DMP) to help members safely use
their opioid medications
We have a program that helps make sure members safely use prescription opioids
and other frequently abused medications. This program is called a Drug Management
Program (DMP). If you use opioid medications that you get from several doctors or
pharmacies, or if you had a recent opioid overdose, we may talk to your doctors to
make sure your use of opioid medications is appropriate and medically necessary.
Working with your doctors, if we decide your use of prescription opioid medications
is not safe, we may limit how you can get those medications. If we place you in our
DMP, the limitations may be:
Requiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid medications from a
certain pharmacy(ies)
Requiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid medications from a
certain doctor(s)
Limiting the amount of opioid medications we will cover for you
If we plan on limiting how you may get these medications or how much you can get,
we will send you a letter in advance. The letter will explain the limitations we think
should apply to you. You will have an opportunity to tell us which doctors or
pharmacies you prefer to use, and about any other information you think is important
for us to know. After you’ve had the opportunity to respond, if we decide to limit your
coverage for these medications, we will send you another letter confirming the
limitation. If you think we made a mistake or you disagree with our determination or
with the limitation, you and your prescriber have the right to appeal. If you appeal,
we will review your case and give you a decision. If we continue to deny any part of
your request related to the limitations that apply to your access to medications, we
will automatically send your case to an independent reviewer outside of our plan. See
Chapter 7 for information about how to ask for an appeal.
You will not be placed in our DMP if you have certain medical conditions, such as
active cancer-related pain or sickle cell disease, you are receiving hospice, palliative,
or end-of-life care, or live in a long-term care facility.

*Section 10.3 Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program to help
members manage their medications
We have a program that can help our members with complex health needs. Our
progam is called a Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program. This program
is voluntary and free. A team of pharmacists and doctors developed the program for
us to help make sure that our members get the most benefit from the drugs they
take.
Some members who take medications for different medical conditions and have high
drug costs, or are in a DMP to help members use their opioids safely, may be able to
get services through an MTM program. A pharmacist or other health professional will
give you a comprehensive review of all your medications. During the review, you can
talk about your medications, your costs, and any problems or questions you have
about your prescription and over-the-counter medications. You’ll get a written summary
which has a recommended to-do list that includes steps you should take to get the
best results from your medications. You’ll also get a medication list that will include
all the medications you’re taking, how much you take, and when and why you take
them. In addition, members in the MTM program will receive information on the safe
disposal of prescription medications that are controlled substances.
It’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about your recommended to-do list and
medication list. Bring the summary with you to your visit or anytime you talk with your
doctors, pharmacists, and other health care providers. Also, keep your medication
list up to date and with you (for example, with your ID) in case you go to the hospital
or emergency room. Also, keep your medication list up to date and keep it with you
(for example, with your ID) in case you go to the hospital or emergency room.
If we have a program that fits your needs, we will automatically enroll you in the
program and send you information. If you decide not to participate, please notify us
and we will withdraw you. If you have any questions about this program, please contact
Customer Service.
