SECTION 9 Do you have “group insurance” or other health
insurance from an employer?
If you (or your spouse) get benefits from your (or your spouse’s) employer or retiree
group as part of this plan, you may call the employer/union benefits administrator or
Customer Service if you have any questions. You can ask about your (or your spouse’s)
employer or retiree health benefits, premiums, or the enrollment period. (Phone
numbers for Customer Service are printed on the back cover of this document.) You
may also call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227; TTY: 1-877-486-2048) with questions
related to your Medicare coverage under this plan.
If you have other prescription drug coverage through your (or your spouse’s) employer
or retiree group, please contact that group’s benefits administrator. The benefits
administrator can help you determine how your current prescription drug coverage
will work with our plan.
