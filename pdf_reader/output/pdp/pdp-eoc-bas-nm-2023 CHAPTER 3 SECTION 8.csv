SECTION 8 Filling a prescription

*Section 8.1 Provide your membership information
To fill your prescription, provide your plan membership information, which can be
found on your membership card, at the network pharmacy you choose. The network
pharmacy will automatically bill the plan for our share of your drug cost. You will need
to pay the pharmacy your share of the cost when you pick up your prescription.

*Section 8.2 What if you don’t have your membership information with you?
If you don’t have your plan membership information with you when you fill your
prescription, you or the pharmacy can call the plan to get the necessary information.
If the pharmacy is not able to get the necessary information, you may have to pay
the full cost of the prescription when you pick it up. (You can then ask us to
reimburse you for our share. See Chapter 5, Section 2 for information about how to
ask the plan for reimbursement.)
