CHAPTER 3:
Using the plan's coverage for Part D
prescription drugs
SECTION 9 Part D drug coverage in special situations

*Section 9.1 What if you’re in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility?
If you are admitted to a hospital or to a skilled nursing facility for a stay covered by
the plan, we will generally cover the cost of your prescription drugs during your stay.
Once you leave the hospital or skilled nursing facility, the plan will cover your
prescription drugs as long as the drugs meet all of our rules for coverage described
in this Chapter.

*Section 9.2 What if you’re a resident in a long-term care (LTC) facility?
Usually, a long-term care (LTC) facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy,
or uses a pharmacy that supplies drugs for all of its residents. If you are a resident of
a LTC facility, you may get your prescription drugs through the facility’s pharmacy or
the one it uses, as long as it is part of our network.
Check your Pharmacy Directory to find out if your LTC facility’s pharmacy or the one
that it uses is part of our network. If it isn’t, or if you need more information or
assistance, please contact Customer Service. If you are in an LTC facility, we must
ensure that you are able to routinely receive your Part D benefits through our network
of LTC pharmacies.
What if you’re a resident in a long-term care (LTC) facility and need a drug that
is not on our Drug List or is restricted in some way?
Please refer to Section 5.2 about a temporary or emergency supply.

*Section 9.3 What if you are taking drugs covered by Original Medicare?
Your enrollment in Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) doesn’t affect your coverage
for drugs covered under Medicare Part A or Part B. If you meet Medicare’s coverage
requirements, your drug will still be covered under Medicare Part A or Part B, even
though you are enrolled in this plan. In addition, if your drug would be covered by
Medicare Part A or Part B, our plan can’t cover it, even if you choose not to enroll in
Part A or Part B.
Some drugs may be covered under Medicare Part B in some situations and through
Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) in other situations. But drugs are never covered
by both Part B and our plan at the same time. In general, your pharmacist or provider
will determine whether to bill Medicare Part B or Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP)
for the drug.

*Section 9.4 What if you have a Medigap (Medicare Supplement Insurance)
policy with prescription drug coverage?
If you currently have a Medigap policy that includes coverage for prescription drugs,
you must contact your Medigap issuer and tell them you have enrolled in our plan. If
you decide to keep your current Medigap policy, your Medigap issuer will remove the
prescription drug coverage portion of your Medigap policy and lower your premium.
Each year your Medigap insurance company should send you a notice that tells if your
prescription drug coverage is “creditable,” and the choices you have for drug coverage.
(If the coverage from the Medigap policy is “creditable,” it means that it is expected
to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage.)
The notice will also explain how much your premium would be lowered if you remove
the prescription drug coverage portion of your Medigap policy. If you didn’t get this
notice, or if you can’t find it, contact your Medigap insurance company and ask for
another copy.

*Section 9.5 What if you’re also getting drug coverage from an employer or
retiree group plan?
If you currently have other prescription drug coverage through your (or your spouse’s)
employer or retiree group, please contact that group’s benefits administrator. He or
she can help you determine how your current prescription drug coverage will work
with our plan.
In general, if you have employee or retiree group coverage, the drug coverage you
get from us will be secondary to your group coverage. That means your group coverage
would pay first.
Special note about ‘creditable coverage’:
Each year your employer or retiree group should send you a notice that tells if your
prescription drug coverage for the next calendar year is “creditable.”
If the coverage from the group plan is “creditable,” it means that the plan has drug
coverage that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard
prescription drug coverage.
Keep this notice about creditable coverage, because you may need them later. If
you enroll in a Medicare plan that includes Part D drug coverage, you may need these
notices to show that you have maintained creditable coverage. If you didn’t get the
creditable coverage notice, request a copy from the employer or retiree group’s
benefits administrator or the employer or union.

*Section 9.6 What if you are in Medicare-certified Hospice?
Hospice and our plan do not cover the same drug at the same time. If you are enrolled
in Medicare hospice and require certain drugs (e.g., anti-nausea, laxative, pain
medication or antianxiety drugs) that are not covered by your hospice because it is
unrelated to your terminal illness and related conditions, our plan must receive
notification from either the prescriber or your hospice provider that the drug is
unrelated before our plan can cover the drug. To prevent delays in receiving these
drugs that should be covered by our plan, ask your hospice provider or prescriber to
provide notification before your prescription is filled.
In the event you either revoke your hospice election or are discharged from hospice,
our plan should cover your drugs as explained in this document. To prevent any delays
at a pharmacy when your Medicare hospice benefit ends, bring documentation to the
pharmacy to verify your revocation or discharge.
