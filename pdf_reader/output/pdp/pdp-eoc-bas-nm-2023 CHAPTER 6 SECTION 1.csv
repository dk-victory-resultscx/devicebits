*Section 1.2 We must ensure that you get timely access to your covered drugs
You have the right to get your prescriptions filled or refilled at any of our network
pharmacies without long delays. If you think that you are not getting your Part D drugs
within a reasonable amount of time, Chapter 7 tells what you can do.

*Section 1.3 We must protect the privacy of your personal health information
Federal and state laws protect the privacy of your medical records and personal health
information. We protect your personal health information as required by these laws.
Your “personal health information” includes the personal information you
gave us when you enrolled in this plan as well as your medical records and
other medical and health information.
You have rights related to your information and controlling how your health
information is used. We give you a written notice, called a “Notice of Privacy
Practice,” that tells about these rights and explains how we protect the privacy
of your health information.
How do we protect the privacy of your health information?
We make sure that unauthorized people don’t see or change your records.
Except for the circumstances noted below, if we intend to give your health
information to anyone who isn’t providing your care or paying for your care,
we are required to get written permission from you or someone you have given
legal power to make decisions for you first.
There are certain exceptions that do not require us to get your written
permission first. These exceptions are allowed or required by law.
We are required to release health information to government agencies
that are checking on quality of care.
Because you are a member of our plan through Medicare, we are required
to give Medicare your health information including information about
your Part D prescription drugs. If Medicare releases your information
for research or other uses, this will be done according to Federal statutes
and regulations; typically, this requires that information that uniquely
identifies you not be shared.
You can see the information in your records and know how it has been shared
with others
You have the right to look at your medical records held at the plan, and to get a copy
of your records. We are allowed to charge you a fee for making copies. You also have
the right to ask us to make additions or corrections to your medical records. If you
ask us to do this, we will work with your healthcare provider to decide whether the
changes should be made.
You have the right to know how your health information has been shared with others
for any purposes that are not routine.
If you have questions or concerns about the privacy of your personal health
information, please call Customer Service.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico (BCBSNM) is required to provide you a
HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices as well as a State Notice of Privacy Practices. The
HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices describes how BCBSNM can use or disclose your
protected health information and your rights to that information under federal law.
The State Notice of Privacy Practices describes how BCBSNM can use or disclose your
nonpublic personal financial information and your rights to that information under
state law. Please take a few minutes and review these notices. You are encouraged
to go to the Blue Access for Members (BAM) portal at BCBSNM.com to sign up to

REVIEWED August 2022

*Section 1.4 We must give you information about the plan, its network of
pharmacies, and your covered drugs
As a member of Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP), you have the right to get several
kinds of information from us.
If you want any of the following kinds of information, please call Customer Service
(phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet):
Information about our plan. This includes, for example, information about
the plan’s financial condition.
Information about our network pharmacies. You have the right to get
information about the qualifications of the pharmacies in our network and
how we pay the pharmacies in our network.
Information about your coverage and the rules you must follow when
using your coverage. Chapters 3 and 4 provide information about Part D
prescription drug coverage.
Information about why something is not covered and what you can do
about it. Chapter 7 provides information on asking for a written explanation
on why a Part D drug is not covered or if your coverage is restricted. Chapter
7 also provides information on asking us to change a decision, also called an
appeal.

*Section 1.5 We must support your right to make decisions about your care
You have the right to give instructions about what is to be done if you are not
able to make medical decisions for yourself
Sometimes people become unable to make health care decisions for themselves due
to accidents or serious illness. You have the right to say what you want to happen if
you are in this situation. This means that, if you want to, you can:
Fill out a written form to give someone the legal authority to make medical
decisions for you if you ever become unable to make decisions for yourself.
Give your doctors written instructions about how you want them to handle
your medical care if you become unable to make decisions for yourself.
The legal documents that you can use to give your directions in advance in these
situations are called “advance directives.” There are different types of advance
directives and different names for them. Documents called “living will” and “power
of attorney for health care” are examples of advance directives.
If you want to use an “advance directive” to give your instructions, here is what to do:
Get the form. If you want to have an advance directive, you can get a form
from your lawyer, from a social worker, or from some office supply stores.
You can sometimes get advance directive forms from organizations that give
people information about Medicare. You can also contact Customer Service
to ask for the forms.
Fill it out and sign it. Regardless of where you get this form, keep in mind
that it is a legal document. You should consider having a lawyer help you
prepare it.
Give copies to appropriate people. You should give a copy of the form to
your doctor and to the person you name on the form who can make decisions
for you if you can’t. You may want to give copies to close friends or family
members. Keep a copy at home.
If you know ahead of time that you are going to be hospitalized, and you have signed
an advance directive, take a copy with you to the hospital.
The hospital will ask you whether you have signed an advance directive form
and whether you have it with you.
If you have not signed an advance directive form, the hospital has forms
available and will ask if you want to sign one.
Remember, it is your choice whether you want to fill out an advance directive
(including whether you want to sign one if you are in the hospital). According to law,
no one can deny you care or discriminate against you based on whether or not you
have signed an advance directive.
What if your instructions are not followed?
If you have signed an advance directive, and you believe that a doctor or hospital did
not follow the instructions in it, you may file a complaint with the New Mexico Human
Resources Department.

*Section 1.6 You have the right to make complaints and to ask us to
reconsider decisions we have made
If you have any problems, concerns, or complaints and need to request coverage, or
make an appeal, Chapter 7 of this document tells what you can do. Whatever you do
– ask for a coverage decision, make an appeal, or make a complaint – we are required
to treat you fairly.

*Section 1.7 What can you do if you believe you are being treated unfairly or
your rights are not being respected?
If it is about discrimination, call the Office for Civil Rights
If you believe you have been treated unfairly or your rights have not been respected
due to your race, disability, religion, sex, health, ethnicity, creed (beliefs), age, sexual
orientation, or national origin, you should call the Department of Health and Human
Services’ Office for Civil Rights at 1-800-368-1019 or TTY 1-800-537-7697, or call your
local Office for Civil Rights.
Is it about something else?
If you believe you have been treated unfairly or your rights have not been respected,
and it’s not about discrimination, you can get help dealing with the problem you are
having:
You can call Customer Service.
You can call the SHIP. For details, go to Chapter 2, Section 3.
