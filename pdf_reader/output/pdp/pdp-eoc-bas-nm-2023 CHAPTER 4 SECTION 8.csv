SECTION 8 Part D Vaccines. What you pay for depends on how and
where you get them
Important Message About What You Pay for Vaccines
Our plan covers most Part D vaccines at no cost to you, even if you haven’t paid your
deductible. Call Customer Service for more information.
There are two parts to our coverage of Part D vaccinations:
The first part of coverage is the cost of the vaccine itself.
The second part of coverage is for the cost of giving you the vaccine. (This
is sometimes called the “administration” of the vaccine.)
Your costs for a Part D vaccination depend on three things:
1. The type of vaccine (what you are being vaccinated for).
Some vaccines are considered medical benefits. (See the Medical Benefits
Chart (what is covered and what you pay) in Chapter 4).
Other vaccines are considered Part D drugs. You can find these vaccines
listed in the plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary).
2. Where you get the vaccine.
The vaccine itself may be dispensed by a pharmacy or provided by the
doctor’s office.
3. Who gives you the vaccine.
A pharmacist may give the vaccine in the pharmacy or another provider
may give it in the doctor’s office.
What you pay at the time you get the Part D vaccination can vary depending on the
circumstances and what Drug Stage you are in.
Sometimes when you get a vaccination, you have to pay for the entire cost
for both the vaccine itself and the cost for the provider to give you the vaccine.
You can ask our plan to pay you back for our share of the cost.
Other times, when you get a vaccination, you will pay only your share of the
cost under your Part D benefit.
Below are three examples of ways you might get a Part D vaccine.
Situation 1: You get your vaccination at the network pharmacy. (Whether you have
this choice depends on where you live. Some states do not allow
pharmacies to give vaccines.)
You will pay the pharmacy your coinsurance or copayment
for the vaccine itself which includes the cost of giving you the
vaccine.
Our plan will pay the remainder of the costs.
Situation 2: You get the Part D vaccination at your doctor’s office.
When you get the vaccine, you will pay for the entire cost of
the vaccine itself and the cost for the provider to give it to
you.
You can then ask our plan to pay our share of the cost by
using the procedures that are described in Chapter 5.
You will be reimbursed the amount you paid less your normal
coinsurance or copayment for the vaccine (including
administration) less any difference between the amount the
doctor charges and what we normally pay. (If you get “Extra
Help,” we will reimburse you for this difference.)
Situation 3: You buy the Part D vaccine itself at your pharmacy, and then take it
to your doctor’s office where they give you the vaccine.
You will have to pay the pharmacy your coinsurance or
copayment for the vaccine itself.
When your doctor gives you the vaccine, you will pay the
entire cost for this service. You can then ask our plan to pay
our share of the cost by using the procedures described in
Chapter 5 of this booklet.
You will be reimbursed the amount charged by the doctor
for administering the vaccine less any difference between
the amount the doctor charges and what we normally pay.
(If you get “Extra Help,” we will reimburse you for this
difference.)
