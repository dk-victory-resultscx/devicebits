SECTION 5 During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share
of your drug costs and you pay your share

*Section 5.1 What you pay for a drug depends on the drug and where you fill
your prescription
During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share of the cost of your covered
prescription drugs, and you pay your share (your copayment or coinsurance amount).
Your share of the cost will vary depending on the drug and where you fill your
prescription.
The plan has 5 Cost-Sharing Tiers
Every drug on the plan’s Drug List is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher
the cost-sharing tier number, the higher your cost for the drug:
Tier 1 Preferred Generic (Lowest Tier)
Tier 2 Generic
Tier 3 Preferred Brand
Tier 4 Non-Preferred Drug
Tier 5 Specialty Tier (Highest Tier)
To find out which cost-sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in the plan’s Drug List.
Your pharmacy choices
How much you pay for a drug depends on whether you get the drug from:
A network retail pharmacy that offers standard cost sharing
A network retail pharmacy that offers preferred cost sharing. Costs may be
less at pharmacies that offer preferred cost sharing.
A pharmacy that is not in the plan’s network. We cover prescriptions filled at
out-of-network pharmacies in only limited situations. Please see Chapter 3,
Section 2.5 to find out when we will cover a prescription filled at an
out-of-network pharmacy.
The plan’s mail-order pharmacy
For more information about these pharmacy choices and filling your prescriptions,
see Chapter 3 and the plan’s Pharmacy Directory.

*Section 5.2 A table that shows your costs for a one-month supply of a drug
During the Initial Coverage Stage, your share of the cost of a covered drug will be
either a copayment or coinsurance.
As shown in the table below, the amount of the copayment or coinsurance depends
on which tier. Sometimes the cost of the drug is lower than your copayment. In these
cases, you pay the lower price for the drug instead of the copayment.

*Section 5.3 If your doctor prescribes less than a full month’s supply, you
may not have to pay the cost of the entire month’s supply
Typically, the amount you pay for a prescription drug covers a full month’s supply.
There may be times when you or your doctor would like you to have less than a
month’s supply of a drug (for example, when you are trying a medication for the first
time). You can also ask your doctor to prescribe, and your pharmacist to dispense,
less than a full month’s supply of your drugs, if this will help you better plan refill dates
for different prescriptions.
If you receive less than a full month’s supply of certain drugs, you will not have to pay
for the full month’s supply.
If you are responsible for coinsurance, you pay a percentage of the total cost
of the drug. Since the coinsurance is based on the total cost of the drug, your
cost will be lower since the total cost for the drug will be lower.
If you are responsible for a copayment for the drug, you will only pay for the
number of days of the drug that you receive instead of a whole month. We

rate”) and multiply it by the number of days of the drug you receive.

*Section 5.4 A table that shows your costs for a long-term (up to a 90-day)
supply of a drug
For some drugs, you can get a long-term supply (also called an "extended supply"). A
long-term supply is up to a 90-day supply.
The table below shows what you pay when you get a long-term supply of a drug.
Sometimes the cost of the drug is lower than your copayment. In these cases,
you pay the lower price for the drug instead of the copayment.

*Section 5.5 You stay in the Initial Coverage Stage until your total drug costs
for the year reach $4,660
You stay in the Initial Coverage Stage until the total amount for the prescription drugs
you have filled reaches the $4,660 limit for the Initial Coverage Stage.
The Part D (EOB) that you receive will help you keep track of how much you, the plan,
and any third parties have spent on your behalf during the year. Many people do not
reach the $4,660 limit in a year.
We will let you know if you reach this $4,660 amount. If you do reach this amount,
you will leave the Initial Coverage Stage and move on to the Coverage Gap Stage. See
Section 1.3 on how Medicare calculates your out-of-pocket costs.
