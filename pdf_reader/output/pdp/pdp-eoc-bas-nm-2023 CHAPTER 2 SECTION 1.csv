Where to send a request asking us to pay for our share of the cost of a drug you
have received
The coverage determination process includes determining requests to pay for our
share of the costs of a drug that you have received. If have received a bill or paid for
services (such as a provider bill) that you think we should pay for, you may need to
ask the plan for reimbursement or to pay the provider bill, see Chapter 5 (Asking us
to pay our share of the costs for covered drugs).
Please note: If you send us a payment request and we deny any part of your request,
you can appeal our decision. See Chapter 7(What to do if you have a problem or complaint
(coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)) for more information.
