SECTION 2 When can you end your membership in our plan?

*Section 2.1 You can end your membership during the Annual Enrollment
Period
You can end your membership in our plan during the Annual Enrollment Period
(also known as the “Annual Open Enrollment Period”). During this time, review your
health and drug coverage and decide about coverage for the upcoming year.
The Annual Enrollment Period is from October 15 to December 7.
Choose to keep your current coverage or make changes to your coverage for
the upcoming year. If you decide to change to a new plan, you can choose
any of the following types of plans:
Another Medicare prescription drug plan.
Original Medicare with a separate Medicare prescription drug plan.
Original Medicare without a separate Medicare prescription drug plan.
If you choose this option, Medicare may enroll you in a drug plan,
unless you have opted out of automatic enrollment.
– or – A Medicare health plan. A Medicare health plan is a plan offered
by a private company that contracts with Medicare to provide all of the
Medicare Part A (Hospital) and Part B (Medical) benefits. Some Medicare
health plans also include Part D prescription drug coverage.
If you enroll in most Medicare health plans, you will be disenrolled from
Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) when your new plan’s coverage begins.
However, if you choose a Private Fee-for-Service plan without Part D drug
coverage, a Medicare Medical Savings Account plan, or a Medicare Cost
Plan, you can enroll in that plan and keep Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic
(PDP) for your drug coverage. If you do not want to keep our plan, you
can choose to enroll in another Medicare prescription drug plan or drop
Medicare prescription drug coverage.
Your membership will end in our plan when your new plan’s coverage
begins on January 1.
Note: If you disenroll from Medicare prescription drug coverage and go without
creditable prescription drug coverage for 63 or more days in a row, you may have to
pay a late enrollment penalty if you join a Medicare drug plan later.

*Section 2.2 In certain situations, you can end your membership during a
Special Enrollment Period

to end their membership at other times of the year. This is known as a Special
Enrollment Period.
