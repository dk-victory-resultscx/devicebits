SECTION 5 More information about your monthly premium

*Section 5.1 There are several ways you can pay your plan premium
There are 4 ways you can pay your plan premium.
Option 1: Paying by check
You will receive a monthly notice indicating when the premium is due. Your premium
st
is due in our office by the 1 day of the month. Checks should be made payable to
Blue Cross MedicareRx and should be mailed to:
Blue Cross MedicareRx
P.O. Box 268845
Oklahoma City, OK 73126-8845
To send payments overnight, please mail to:
Blue Cross MedicareRx
3232 West Reno
Lockbox #268845
Oklahoma City, OK 73107
Option 2: You can pay via automatic withdrawal
Instead of paying by check, you can have your monthly plan premium automatically
withdrawn from your bank account. Automatic withdrawals of the premium from
th
your bank account will take place on a monthly basis on approximately the 4 day of
each month. You can request an ACH form to set up automatic withdrawals from your
bank account by contacting Customer Service or visiting our website, getbluenm.com/
pdp.
Option 3: Check Payment by Phone
You can make an expedited premium payment by phone. Call 1-866-398-9054 to
complete a check payment by phone.
Option 4: Having your premium taken out of your monthly Social Security check
Changing the way you pay your premium. If you decide to change the way you pay
your premium, it can take up to three months for your new payment method to take
effect. While we are processing your request for a new payment method, you are
responsible for making sure that your plan premium is paid on time. To change your
premium contact Customer Service for more information on how to pay your monthly
plan premium this way. We will be happy to help you set this up.
What to do if you are having trouble paying your plan premium
st
Your plan premium is due in our office by the 1 day of the month. If we have not
th
received your premium by the 5 day of the month, we will send you a notice telling
you that your plan membership will end if we do not receive your premium payment
within 90 days.
If you are having trouble paying your premium on time, please contact Customer
Service to see if we can direct you to programs that will help with your plan premium.
If we end your membership because you did not pay your premiums, you will still
have health coverage under Original Medicare.
If we end your membership with the plan because you did not pay your premiums,
and you don’t currently have prescription drug coverage then you may not be able to
receive Part D coverage until the following year if you enroll in a new plan during the
annual enrollment period. During the annual Medicare open enrollment period, you
may either join a stand-alone prescription drug plan or a health plan that also provides
drug coverage. (If you go without "creditable" drug coverage for more than 63 days,
you may have to pay a Part D late enrollment penalty for as long as you have Part D
coverage.)
At the time we end your membership, you may still owe us for premiums you have
not paid. We have the right to pursue collection of the premiums you owe. In the
future, if you want to enroll again in our plan (or another plan that we offer), you will
need to pay the amount you owe before you can enroll.
If you think we have wrongfully ended your membership, you can make a complaint
(also called a grievance); see Chapter 7 for how to file a complaint. If you had an
emergency circumstance that was out of your control and it caused you to not be able
to pay your plan premium within our grace period, you can make a complaint. For
complaints, we will review our decision again. Chapter 7, Section 7 of this document
tells how to make a complaint or you can call us at 1-888-285-2249 between 8:00 a.m.
– 8:00 p.m., local time, 7 days a week. If you are calling from April 1 through September
30, alternate technologies (for example, voicemail) will be used on weekends and
holidays. TTY users should call 711. You must make your request no later than 60
days after the date your membership ends.

*Section 5.2 Can we change your monthly plan premium during the year?
No. We are not allowed to change the amount we charge for the plan’s monthly plan
premium during the year. If the monthly plan premium changes for next year we will
tell you in September and the change will take effect on January 1.
However, in some cases the part of the premium that you have to pay can change
during the year. This happens if you become eligible for the “Extra Help” program or
if you lose your eligibility for the “Extra Help” program during the year. If a member
qualifies for “Extra Help” with their prescription drug costs, the “Extra Help” program
will pay part of the member’s monthly plan premium. A member who loses their
eligibility during the year will need to start paying their full monthly premium. You
can find out more about the “Extra Help” program in Chapter 2, Section 7.
