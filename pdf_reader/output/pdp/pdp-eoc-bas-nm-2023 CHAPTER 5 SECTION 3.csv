SECTION 3 We will consider your request for payment and say yes
or no

*Section 3.1 We check to see whether we should cover the drug and how
much we owe
When we receive your request for payment, we will let you know if we need any
additional information from you. Otherwise, we will consider your request and make
a coverage decision.
If we decide that the drug is covered and you followed all the rules, we will
pay for our share of the cost. We will mail your reimbursement of our share
of the cost to you. We will send payment within 30 days after your request
was received.
If we decide that the drug is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules,
we will not pay for our share of the cost. We will send you a letter explaining
the reasons why we are not sending the payment and your rights to appeal
that decision.

*Section 3.2 If we tell you that we will not pay for all or part of the drug, you
can make an appeal
If you think we have made a mistake in turning down your request for payment or
the amount we are paying, you can make an appeal. If you make an appeal, it means
you are asking us to change the decision we made when we turned down your request
for payment.
The appeals process is a formal process with detailed procedures and important
deadlines. For the details on how to make this appeal, go to Chapter 7 of this document.
