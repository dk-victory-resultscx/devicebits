SECTION 7 How other insurance works with our plan
Other insurance
Medicare requires that we collect information from you about any other medical or
drug insurance coverage that you have. That’s because we must coordinate any other
coverage you have with your benefits under our plan. This is called Coordination of
Benefits.
Once each year, we will send you a letter that lists any other medical or drug insurance
coverage that we know about. Please read over this information carefully. If it is correct,
you don’t need to do anything. If the information is incorrect, or if you have other
coverage that is not listed, please call Customer Service. You may need to give your
plan member ID number to your other insurers (once you have confirmed their identity)
so your bills are paid correctly and on time.
When you have other insurance (like employer group health coverage), there are rules
set by Medicare that decide whether our plan or your other insurance pays first. The
insurance that pays first is called the “primary payer” and pays up to the limits of its
coverage. The one that pays second, called the “secondary payer,” only pays if there
are costs left uncovered by the primary coverage. The secondary payer may not pay
all of the uncovered costs. If you have other insurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and
pharmacy.
These rules apply for employer or union group health plan coverage:
If you have retiree coverage, Medicare pays first.
If your group health plan coverage is based on your or a family member’s
current employment, who pays first depends on your age, the number of
people employed by your employer, and whether you have Medicare based
on age, disability, or End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD):
If you’re under 65 and disabled and you or your family member is still
working, your group health plan pays first if the employer has 100 or
more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan
that has more than 100 employees.
If you’re over 65 and you or your spouse is still working, your group health
plan pays first if the employer has 20 or more employees or at least one
employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 20 employees.
If you have Medicare because of ESRD, your group health plan will pay first
for the first 30 months after you become eligible for Medicare.
These types of coverage usually pay first for services related to each type:
No-fault insurance (including automobile insurance)
Liability (including automobile insurance)
Black lung benefits
Workers’ compensation
Medicaid and TRICARE never pay first for Medicare-covered services. They only pay
after Medicare, employer group health plans, and/or Medigap have paid.
If you have other insurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and pharmacy. If you have
questions about who pays first, or you need to update your other insurance
information, call Customer Service (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of
this booklet). You may need to give your plan member ID number to your other
insurers (once you have confirmed their identity) so your bills are paid correctly and
on time.
