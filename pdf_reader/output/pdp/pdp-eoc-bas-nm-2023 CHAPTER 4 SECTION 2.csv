SECTION 2 What you pay for a drug depends on which “drug
payment stage” you are in when you get the drug

*Section 2.1 What are the drug payment stages for Blue Cross MedicareRx
Basic (PDP) members?
There are four “drug payment stages” for your prescription drug coverage under Blue
Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP). How much you pay depends on which of these stages
you are in at the time you get a prescription filled or refilled. Keep in mind you are
always responsible for the plan’s monthly premium regardless of the drug payment
stage. Details of each stage are in Sections 4 through 7 of this chapter. The stages are:
Stage 1: Yearly Deductible Stage
Stage 2: Initial Coverage Stage
Stage 3: Coverage Gap Stage
Stage 4: Catastrophic Coverage Stage
Important Message About What You Pay for Insulin
You won’t pay more than $35 for a one-month supply of each insulin product covered
by our plan, no matter what cost-sharing tier it’s on, even if you haven’t paid your
deductible.
