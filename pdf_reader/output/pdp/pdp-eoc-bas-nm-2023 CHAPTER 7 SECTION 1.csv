SECTION 1 Introduction

*Section 1.1 What to do if you have a problem or concern
This chapter explains two types of processes for handling problems and concerns:
For some problems, you need to use the process for coverage decisions
and appeals.
For other problems, you need to use the process for making complaints;
also called grievances
Both of these processes have been approved by Medicare. Each process has a set of
rules, procedures, and deadlines that must be followed by us and by you.
The guide in Section 3 will help you identify the right process to use and what you
should do.

*Section 1.2 What about the legal terms?
There are legal terms for some of the rules, procedures, and types of deadlines
explained in this chapter. Many of these terms are unfamiliar to most people and can
be hard to understand. To make things easier, this chapter:
Uses simpler words in place of certain legal terms. For example, this chapter
generally says “making a complaint” rather than “filing a grievance,” “coverage
decision” rather than “coverage determination” or “at-risk determination,”
and “independent review organization” instead of “Independent Review Entity.”
It also uses abbreviations as little as possible.
However, it can be helpful – and sometimes quite important – for you to know the
correct legal terms. Knowing which terms to use will help you communicate more
accurately to get the right help or information for your situation. To help you know
which terms to use, we include legal terms when we give the details for handling
specific types of situations.
