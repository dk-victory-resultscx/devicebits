We don’t discriminate based on race, ethnicity, national origin, color, religion, sex,

Discrimination Act of 1975, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 1557 of the

and any other laws and rules that apply for any other reason.
If you want more information or have concerns about discrimination or unfair
treatment, please call the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil
Rights at 1-800-368-1019 (TTY 1-800-537-7697) or your local Office for Civil Rights.
If you have a disability and need help with access to care, please call us at Customer
Service. If you have a complaint, such as a problem with wheelchair access, Customer
Service can help.
