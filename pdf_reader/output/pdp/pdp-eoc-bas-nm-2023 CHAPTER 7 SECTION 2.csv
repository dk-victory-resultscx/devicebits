CHAPTER 7:
What to do if you have a problem
or complaint
(coverage decisions, appeals,
complaints)
SECTION 2 Where to get more information and personalized
assistance
We are always available to help you. Even if you have a complaint about our treatment
of you, we are obligated to honor your right to complain. Therefore, you should always
reach out to customer service for help. But in some situations you may also want help
or guidance from someone who is not connected with us. Below are two entities that
can assist you.
State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)
Each state has a government program with trained counselors. The program is not
connected with us or with any insurance company or health plan. The counselors at
this program can help you understand which process you should use to handle a
problem you are having. They can also answer your questions, give you more
information, and offer guidance on what to do.
The services of SHIP counselors are free. You will find phone and website URLs
numbers in Chapter 2, Section 3 of this document.
Medicare
You can also contact Medicare to get help. To contact Medicare:
You can call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.
You can also visit the Medicare website (www.medicare.gov).
