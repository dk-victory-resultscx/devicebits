There are programs to help people with limited resources pay for their drugs. These
include “Extra Help” and State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs. Chapter 2,
Section 7 tells more about these programs. If you qualify, enrolling in the program
might lower your monthly plan premium.
If you are already enrolled and getting help from one of these programs, the
information about premiums in this Evidence of Coverage may not apply to you.
We have included a separate insert, called the “Evidence of Coverage Rider for People
Who Get Extra Help Paying for Prescription Drugs” (also known as the “Low Income
Subsidy Rider” or the “LIS Rider”), which tells you about your drug coverage. If you
don’t have this insert, please call Customer Service and ask for the “LIS Rider.”
Medicare Part B and Part D premiums differ for people with different incomes. If you
have questions about these premiums review your copy of Medicare & You 2023
handbook, the section called “2023 Medicare Costs.” If you need a copy you can
download it from the Medicare website (www.medicare.gov). Or, you can order a
printed copy by phone at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week. TTY users call 1-877-486-2048.

*Section 4.1 Plan Premium
As a member of our plan, you pay a monthly plan premium. For 2023, the monthly
premium for Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP) is $76.70.

*Section 4.2 Monthly Medicare Part B Premium
Many members are required to pay other Medicare premiums
In addition to paying the monthly plan premium, you must continue paying your
Medicare premiums to remain a member of the plan. This includes your premium
for Part B. It may also include a premium for Part A which affects members who aren’t
eligible for premium free Part A.

*Section 4.3 Part D Late Enrollment Penalty
Some members are required to pay a Part D late enrollment penalty. The Part D
late enrollment penalty is an additional premium that must be paid for Part D coverage
if at any time after your initial enrollment period is over, there is a period of 63 days
or more in a row when you did not have Part D or other creditable prescription drug
coverage. “Creditable prescription drug coverage” is coverage that meets Medicare’s
minimum standards since it is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as
Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage. The cost of the late enrollment penalty
depends on how long you went without Part D or other creditable prescription drug
coverage. You will have to pay this penalty for as long as you have Part D coverage.
The Part D late enrollment penalty is added to your monthly premium. When you first
enroll in Blue Cross MedicareRx Basic (PDP), we let you know the amount of the
penalty. If you do not pay your Part D late enrollment penalty, you could lose your
prescription drug benefits.
You will not have to pay it if:
You receive “Extra Help” from Medicare to pay for your prescription drugs.
You have gone less than 63 days in a row without creditable coverage.
You have had creditable drug coverage through another source such as a
former employer, union, TRICARE, or Department of Veterans Affairs. Your
insurer or your human resources department will tell you each year if your
drug coverage is creditable coverage. This information may be sent to you
in a letter or included in a newsletter from the plan. Keep this information,
because you may need it if you join a Medicare drug plan later.
Note: Any notice must state that you had “creditable” prescription drug
coverage that is expected to pay as much as Medicare’s standard
prescription drug plan pays.
Note: The following are not creditable prescription drug coverage:
prescription drug discount cards, free clinics, and drug discount websites.
Medicare determines the amount of the penalty. Here is how it works:
If you went 63 days or more without Part D or other creditable prescription
drug coverage after you were first eligible to enroll in Part D, the plan will
count the number of full months that you did not have coverage. The penalty
is 1% for every month that you did not have creditable coverage. For example,
if you go 14 months without coverage, the penalty will be 14%.
Then Medicare determines the amount of the average monthly premium for
Medicare drug plans in the nation from the previous year. For 2023, this
average premium amount is $32.74.
To calculate your monthly penalty, you multiply the penalty percentage and
the average monthly premium and then round it to the nearest 10 cents. In
the example here it would be 14% times $32.74, which equals $4.5836. This
rounds to $4.58. This amount would be added to the monthly premium
for someone with a Part D late enrollment penalty.
There are three important things to note about this monthly Part D late enrollment
penalty:
First, the penalty may change each year, because the average monthly
premium can change each year.
Second, you will continue to pay a penalty every month for as long as you
are enrolled in a plan that has Medicare Part D drug benefits, even if you
change plans.
Third, if you are under 65 and currently receiving Medicare benefits, the
Part D late enrollment penalty will reset when you turn 65. After age 65, your
Part D late enrollment penalty will be based only on the months that you
don’t have coverage after your initial enrollment period for aging into
Medicare.
If you disagree about your Part D late enrollment penalty, you or your
representative can ask for a review. Generally, you must request this review within
60 days from the date on the first letter you receive stating you have to pay a late
enrollment penalty. However, if you were paying a penalty before joining our plan,
you may not have another chance to request a review of that late enrollment penalty.
Important: Do not stop paying your Part D late enrollment penalty while you’re waiting
for a review of the decision about your late enrollment penalty. If you do, you could
be disenrolled for failure to pay your plan premiums.

*Section 4.4 Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount
Some members may be required to pay an extra charge, known as the Part D Income
Related Monthly Adjustment Amount, also known as IRMAA. The extra charge is figured
out using your modified adjusted gross income as reported on your IRS tax return
from 2 years ago. If this amount is above a certain amount, you’ll pay the standard
premium amount and the additional IRMAA. For more information on the extra amount
you may have to pay based on your income, visit https://www.medicare.gov/drug-
coverage-part-d/costs-for-medicare-drug-coverage/monthly-premium-for-drug-plans.
If you have to pay an extra amount, Social Security, not your Medicare plan, will send
you a letter telling you what that extra amount will be. The extra amount will be
withheld from your Social Security, Railroad Retirement Board, or Office of Personnel
Management benefit check, no matter how you usually pay your plan premium, unless
your monthly benefit isn’t enough to cover the extra amount owed. If your benefit
check isn’t enough to cover the extra amount, you will get a bill from Medicare. You
must pay the extra amount to the government. It cannot be paid with your
monthly plan premium. If you do not pay the extra amount you will be
disenrolled from the plan and lose prescription drug coverage.
If you disagree about paying an extra amount, you can ask Social Security to review
the decision. To find out more about how to do this, contact Social Security at
1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778).
