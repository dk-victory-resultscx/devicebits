SECTION 4 There are restrictions on coverage for some drugs

*Section 4.1 Why do some drugs have restrictions?
For certain prescription drugs, special rules restrict how and when the plan covers
them. A team of doctors and pharmacists developed these rules to encourage you
and your provider to use drugs in the most effective way. To find out if any of these
restrictions apply to a drug you take or want to take, check the Drug List
Please note that sometimes a drug may appear more than once in our drug list. This
is because the same drugs can differ based on the strength, amount, or form of the
drug prescribed by your health care provider, and different restrictions or cost sharing
may apply to the different versions of the drug (for instance, 10 mg versus 100 mg;
one per day versus two per day; tablet versus liquid).

*Section 4.2 What kinds of restrictions?
The sections below tell you more about the types of restrictions we use for certain
drugs.
If there is a restriction for your drug, it usually means that you or your provider
will have to take extra steps in order for us to cover the drug. Contact Customer
Service to learn what you or your provider would need to do to get coverage for the
drug. If you want us to waive the restriction for you, you will need to use the coverage
decision process and ask us to make an exception. We may or may not agree to waive
the restriction for you. (See Chapter 9)
Restricting brand name drugs when a generic version is available
Generally, a “generic” drug works the same as a brand name drug and usually costs
less. In most cases, when a generic version of a brand name drug is available,
our network pharmacies will provide you the generic version instead ofthe
brand name drug. However, if your provider has told us the medical reason that
neither the generic drug nor other covered drugs that treat the same condition will
work for you, then we will cover the brand name drug. (Your share of the cost may
be greater for the brand name drug than for the generic drug.)
Getting plan approval in advance
For certain drugs, you or your provider need to get approval from the plan before we
will agree to cover the drug for you. This is called “prior authorization.” This is put
in place to ensure medication safety and help guide appropriate use of certain drugs.
If you do not get this approval, your drug might not be covered by the plan.
Trying a different drug first
This requirement encourages you to try less costly but usually just as effective drugs
before the plan covers another drug. For example, if Drug A and Drug B treat the
same medical condition, the plan may require you to try Drug A first. If Drug A does
not work for you, the plan will then cover Drug B. This requirement to try a different
drug first is called “step therapy.”
Quantity limits
For certain drugs, we limit how much of a drug you can get each time you fill your
prescription. For example, if it is normally considered safe to take only one pill per
day for a certain drug, we may limit coverage for your prescription to no more than
one pill per day.
