SECTION 3 Your drugs need to be on the plan’s “Drug List”

*Section 3.1 The “Drug List” tells which Part D drugs are covered
The plan has a "List of Covered Drugs (Formulary)." In this Evidence of Coverage, we call
it the "Drug List" for short.
The drugs on this list are selected by the plan with the help of a team of doctors and
pharmacists. The list meets Medicare's requirements and has been approved by
Medicare.
The drugs on the Drug List are only those covered under Medicare Part D.
We will generally cover a drug on the plan’s Drug List as long as you follow the other
coverage rules explained in this chapter and the use of the drug is a medically accepted
indication. A “medically accepted indication” is a use of the drug that is either:
Approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis or condition
for which it is being prescribed.
-- or -- Supported by certain references, such as the American Hospital
Formulary Service Drug Information and the DRUGDEX Information System.
The Drug List includes brand name drugs, generic drugs, and biosimilars.
A brand name drug is a prescription drug that is sold under a trademarked name
owned by the drug manufacturer. Brand name drugs that are more complex than
typical drugs (for example, drugs that are based on a protein) are called biological
products. On the drug list, when we refer to “drugs,” this could mean a drug or a
biological product.
A generic drug is a prescription drug that has the same active ingredients as the brand
name drug. Since biological products are more complex than typical drugs, instead
of having a generic form, they have alternatives that are called biosimilars. Generally,
generics and biosimilars work just as well as the brand name drug or biological product
and usually cost less. There are generic drug substitutes or biosimilar alternatives
available for many brand name drugs and some biological products.
What is not on the Drug List?
The plan does not cover all prescription drugs.
In some cases, the law does not allow any Medicare plan to cover certain
types of drugs (for more about this, see Section 7.1 in this chapter).
In other cases, we have decided not to include a particular drug on the Drug
List. In some cases, you may be able to obtain a drug that is not on the drug
list. For more information, please see Chapter 9.

*Section 3.2 There are 5 “cost-sharing tiers” for drugs on the Drug List
Every drug on the plan’s Drug List is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher
the cost-sharing tier, the higher your cost for the drug:
Tier 1 Preferred Generic (Lowest Tier)
Tier 2 Generic
Tier 3 Preferred Brand
Tier 4 Non-Preferred Drug
Tier 5 Specialty Tier (Highest Tier)
To find out which cost-sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in the plan’s Drug List.
The amount you pay for drugs in each cost-sharing tier is shown in Chapter 4 (What
you pay for your Part D prescription drugs).

*Section 3.3 How can you find out if a specific drug is on the Drug List?
You have 3 ways to find out:
1. Check the most recent Drug List we provided electronically.
2. Visit the plan’s website (getbluenm.com/pdp). The Drug List on the website
is always the most current.
3. Call Customer Service to find out if a particular drug is on the plan’s Drug List
or to ask for a copy of the list.
