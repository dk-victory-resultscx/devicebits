SECTION 6 Taking your appeal to Level 3 and beyond

*Section 6.1 Appeal Levels 3, 4 and 5 for Part D Drug Requests
This section may be appropriate for you if you have made a Level 1 appeal and a Level
2 appeal, and both of your appeals have been turned down.
If the value of the drug you have appealed meets a certain dollar amount, you may
be able to go on to additional levels of appeal. If the dollar amount is less, you cannot
appeal any further. The written response you receive to your Level 2 appeal will explain
who to contact and what to do to ask for a Level 3 appeal.
For most situations that involve appeals, the last three levels of appeal work in much
the same way. Here is who handles the review of your appeal at each of these levels.
Level 3 appeal An Administrative Law Judge or an attorney adjudicator
who works for the Federal government will review your
appeal and give you an answer.
If the answer is yes, the appeals process is over. We must authorize or
provide the drug coverage that was approved by the Administrative Law
Judge or attorney adjudicator within 72 hours (24 hours for expedited
appeals) or make payment no later than 30 calendar days after we receive
the decision.
If the Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator says no to your
appeal, the appeals process may or may not be over.
If you decide to accept this decision that turns down your appeal, the
appeals process is over.
If you do not want to accept the decision, you can continue to the next
level of the review process. The notice you get will tell you what to do
for a Level 4 appeal.
Level 4 appeal The MedicareAppeals Council (Council) will review your appeal
and give you an answer. The Council is part of the Federal
government.
If the answer is yes, the appeals process is over. We must authorize or
provide the drug coverage that was approved by the Council within 72
hours (24 hours for expedited appeals) or make payment no later than
30 calendar days after we receive the decision.
If the answer is no, the appeals process may or may not be over.
If you decide to accept this decision that turns down your appeal, the
appeals process is over.
If you do not want to accept the decision, you may be able to continue
to the next level of the review process. If the Council says no to your
appeal or denies your request to review the appeal, the notice will tell
you whether the rules allow you to go on to a Level 5 appeal. It will also
tell you who to contact and what to do next if you choose to continue
with your appeal.
Level 5 appeal A judge at the Federal District Court will review your appeal.
A judge will review all of the information and decide yes or no to your request.
This is a final answer. There are no more appeal levels after the Federal
District Court.
